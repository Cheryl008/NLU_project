3,1,"The same reasons women do.  \n\nthe ""game""...is all about having your cake and eating it too.\n\nAlot of people play mind games, such as leading someone on when they know they are not going to be faithful or to get something out of the relationship they would not have initially gotten.\n\nNo one really wants to be alone and men in general are more commitment-phobic then women so they are more likely to have a couple girls stung along until they find ""something better."""

11,1,"I've never heard the Judas story.  But Dracula was a real person.  His name was Vlad Dracul, a count and later prince in Romania.  His army was fighting off the Ottomans (Turks) trying to invade Eastern Europe.  Whenever an Ottoman warrior was caught, he would have them impaled on a stake and would watch them die painful, long deaths...sometimes while eating his dinner.  Eventually, Dracul was captured and beheaded...his head sent back to Turkey to show the Sultan that he was dead.\n\nElizabeth of Bathory is another true story...a mass murderer who killed something like 600 virgins to bathe in their blood and stay young.  She was eventually caught and locked up in her castle forever.\n\nBetween the two, as well as other stories, Bram Stoker developed his monster who he named Dracula."

16,1,"I am not sure but it is probably like a roll or two of toilet paper a day. Since I pee alot and I use a lot of toilet paper when I pee to make sure that I am perfectly dry. So there goes over half right there. And he does sh*t alot, so there goes the rest of it.\n\nShampoo goes well since we do not wash our hair that often. I forget his reasoning but I get dandruff if I wash my hair daily. So a normal bottle of shampoo probably takes about three to four weeks. So, I'd say that that is pretty good for two people.\n\nAnd as for toothpaste, a normal tube probably goes in about one or two weeks. Since we brush our teeth like we are supposed to. I'd say that that is a normal amount too.\n\nDoes that sound about right, My Limo Driver?"
17,1,"I agree on some things, and disagree on a lot more. My life priority is not to make a lot of money. That is not my idea of success. And societies are strongly influenced by religious standards which I don't agree with. Also, I don't think a person is worth what he or she looks like. And I don't think it is funny to laugh at another person's misfortune.\n\nBut then again, living in Occident, I agree that human life is a value. In Argentina, where I live, friendship is a very important value, too, and I agree about that. And I share some Occidental moral values, if you compare them to those in Arabic countries. In that respect, I'm glad I was born here."

25,1,"In our society love seems to be whatever someone likes. The Bible calls what we call love - Lust. In the Bible love is not a feeling but a character quality the root of which is giving. People who give of themselves to meet the need of others are exercising love. The Bible never defines love, but it does describe it in 1 Corinthins 13. ""Love is patient, love is kind and is not jealous; love does not brag and is not arrogant,   5 does not act unbecomingly; it does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered,   6 does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;   7 bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.   8 Love never fails"""
26,1,Not in Bible. I thought the Catholics stopped that practice on the 60's? Maybe some still do? They are not consistent from place to place-but who else is.
27,1,"ok most of the answers posted by you dumbas$es are very stupid and unfunny. the origins of the dot, ancient word ""tilak"", now used as Bindi are not exactly known. it symbolizes marriage - in ancient aryan society a groom used to apply his blood on-his bride's forehead as a recognition of wedlock. today, the indian woman wears a red dot which is probably a survival of this idea. \nnow it's mainly worn as a fashion accessory and they come in cool shapes like tear drops and have diamonds and whatever on it. here's more info: http://hinduism.about.com/library/weekly/aa072002a.htm\n\noh and also, wearing a ""dot"" is NOT the equivalent to a wedding band."
28,1,Japan. It pretty much means - Hello?
29,1,"What's up with this question?  But since you asked, the answer depends on you and what you do with your life from now on.

Treating others the way that I want to be treated.  \n2) I can model Jesus and His generous attitude by......helping others out everyday.  Don't just do a ""good deed"" everyday, when you see someone that just needs a hand lend it to them ( and if you do, you will feel so good)\n3) I can look in the bible and I can see God's love and see His justice.  I can demonstrate everything in the bible by just living according to the guidelines of God's Word.\n4) Giving what you have to others.\n5) society, peer pressure, everyday life....."

37,1,"They don't necessarily, but there's this idea out there that big ones are more attractive to men.  Yes, to some men, they are, but not all of us.  And to those of us who've had the unique clinical experience of showing a new mother now to nurse her infant, the sight of big ones tells us we're going to spend a bit more time with this young lady - it's harder for well-endowed girls to nurse than for those whose attributes are, shall we say, a touch more modest.  But even the most richly blessed girls can learn to nurse their babies successfully - it just demands more time and patience  to teach 'em."

47,1,"It's a Judeo-Christian tradition, so if that works for you, you'll get something from it.  \n\nIt is actually a good background to have.  A lot of Golden Dawn material which Gardner ""borrowed"" is taken from the Kabbalistic tradiction.  The Waite-Rider Tarot is loaded with Kabbalistic symbolism as well.  So it's a good reference book at the least."
48,1,"""You have heard that it was said to your ancestors, 'You shall not kill; and whoever kills will be liable to judgment.' But I say to you, whoever is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment, and whoever says to his brother, 'Raqa,' will be answerable to the Sanhedrin, and whoever says, 'You fool,' will be liable to fiery Gehenna."" Mt 5:21-22.\n\nAnger is the motive behind murder, as the insulting epithets are steps that may lead to it. They, as well as the deed, are all forbidden. Raqa: an Aramaic word reqa' or reqa probably meaning ""imbecile,"" ""blockhead,"" a term of abuse. The ascending order of punishment, judgment (by a local council?), trial before the Sanhedrin, condemnation to Gehenna, points to a higher degree of seriousness in each of the offenses. Sanhedrin: the highest judicial body of Judaism. Gehenna: in Hebrew ge-hinnom, ""Valley of Hinnom,"" or ge ben-hinnom, ""Valley of the son of Hinnom,"" southwest of Jerusalem, the center of an idolatrous cult during the monarchy in which children were offered in sacrifice. In Joshua 18:16 the Hebrew is transliterated into Greek as gaienna, which appears in the New Testament as geenna. The concept of punishment of sinners by fire either after death or after the final judgment is found in Jewish apocalyptic literature but the name geenna is first given to the place of punishment in the New Testament."

51,1,If he's not seeing anyone and he's not gay then I'm afraid to say the answer is show an interest in him.  If you show an interest then 90% of guys will be interested back I'm sorry to say.  We are just not that complex.  Of course thats not quite the same as getting him to like you but you could probably get a date and go from there.
52,1,"Our government spends billions a year on pointless test, and reports, once they studied why the tricycle was so dangerous after one year they reported: because it falls down so easy.  OK!

56,1,"There are so many.  The fact that the church is going through a transformation shows that we are getting ready or preparing ourselves for Jesus (we all know that Jesus looks at the church as His bride).  On top of that, the way, the famine, the increasingly horrible natural disasters...It all points to a greater implication than just global warming.  The devil is tightening his grasp on this world and will soon make his final push to take it over.  When that happens, Christ will return and save his faithful followers.  Wait and see."
57,1,"I have no idea why they're so uptight. They feel that if they suffered in the past they have the right to be the country's little princesses.

Who then makes that moral judgement that they are worthy?\n I believe everyone shoud be treated respectfully at all times. \n How can you assume to know that they are thinking a certain way to begin with. \n If their opinion is different than yours does that make them less worthy?\n You never know to whom you are speaking so why treat them any differently than you yourself wish to be treated?

75,1,"Ellen used to live a very closeted lifestyle, but since she came out, her popularity has gone way up.\n\nI think it has to do with the fact that people are comfortable with people that are honest about themselves. It fosters a sense of intimacy when you know a person's DEEP DARK SECRET. Once they have confided that in you, you see the person as more honest, and therefore more approachable.\n\nI watch the Ellen show whenever I can, and even though she doesn't wear make up, or a dress, and always seems to wear a pair of Converse sneakers, it's her honesty and openness that people respond to- it makes her a very attractive person."

Some, or most, of the people live with their parents, or someone close by, which would be free rent, which is what I will be doing. There are some that move away for their year of service, which is what the stepind is for. It is acctually very doable to live on 175 dollars a week, You just have to budget well. They'll help you out, by setting you up with room mates, and helping you look for an apartment. They strongly suggest four people to a two bedroom apartment and in walking distance (or in an area with public transportation). They don't have any sort of dorms on any of their sites. Although, in the near furtute the Boston site will have dorms. With the 175 a week you won't be able to go out to the movies every week, or anything, but it's do able, and you'll still have spending money. You mentioned you live in that area. I suggest you do what I'm doing. I applied to my nearest site, so I can stay with my parents, and I'm going to direct deposit my stipend into an account for college, and I'll move my hours and keep my part time job later at night. (Most students either go to school or have a part time job after City Year, you just have to make sure it never cuts into your commitment.) So, no, you wouldn't have to leave work, but you may need to change your hours to gaurtee you won't be working before 6:30 PM.

In many other cultures they care for their elderly parents in their homes and have great respect for them. Personally, I think we are so caught up with our own lives we many times forget who brought us into the world, we owe them that much respect to care for them and not send them to a nursing home.

94,1,"no, I don't think that finding the right partner is all nonsense.  I feel it is very true that it is pretty impossible to find the 'right' partner.  People are just so different.  However I don't feel that the monks have it right either, because spending all of your time focusing on inner growth won't do much good in the world.  The best answer to this question would have to be, that yes you should have a partner, but no you don't NEED a partner, because everyone is different, I know several people that work better alone and they are fine with it.  Most people shouldn't go through life alone, that's not why we were put here (not going into religious ideologies).

95,1,"Who are God's chosen people?\n\nGod's chosen people are the ""elect"", whether those of faith prior to Christ's coming or after.  This is the mystery of the gospel.\n\nRomans 2:28-29 and Galations 3:28-29 tells us who a true ""Jew"" is...all ""in Christ"".  It has nothing to do with race or gender.\n\nThe ""Israel of God"" (Galations 6:16) are all who identify themselves to Him through faith in His Son, Jesus Christ and who obey Him.\n\nGod is no respecter of persons.  To give special consideration to a physical nation or group of people is Zionistic and anti-scriptural.  It is to miss completely WHO Abraham's seed really is.\n\nAbraham's seed is Christ.  Abraham was not a Jew.  Jacob had not even been born to Isaac yet.  And it is for Jacob that Israel was named, and Judah was a son of Jacob (name later changed to Israel).  It is from Judah that the name ""Jew"" comes.  Therefore, Abraham was not a Jew. \n\nSo, all ""in Christ"" are Abraham's true lineage who will inherit the promises God promised to Him.

We are bombarded with music, actors, newsreaders etc. who have an 'attitude problem'. Politeness is not 'in' and rudness, carelessness and stupidity rules. Rather than focusing on our looks and sex and stuff why don't we focus on advertising some manners? I could rant on and on and on but I don't want to bore you or the other Answers readers to tears."

103,1,"Wow, Mr. Grail. Does your compassionate religion teach you that? I think not. Not all homeless people are ""drunk 24/7"" as you say. Neither are all of them weak and pathetic. Some of them may actually be working, but can't afford a place to live. Have you really thought about that? Hmm? Let me dispel the little illusion you have in your mind about being homeless. Being homeless is rough, and I've been there before. Alcohol is not even remotely as important as food and clean water. I've been dumpster diving before. It's humiliating, but you lose your pride and live with it. Another thing, it's not so simple to get a job these days. When you're wearing rags or dirty clothes, not many people will hire you. Think about that. If you're homeless, it's not so easy getting clean clothes and/or keeping them clean.\n\nI think everyone should experience being homeless at one stage in their life. It gives you better meaning in your life and makes you appreciated the good things in life and how easy we have it here in the States. I hope everyday you pride yourself in walking by a homeless person and in essence, spitting on them. I take offense to that, because I've been there. Shame on you!"

117,1,"Some believe there is a three in one, the trinity, Bible Scholar's cannot explain it, and even ""Schnab"" cannot explain the trinity, and the reason is because there is no such thing as the trinity.  And Jesus proves it with this Scripture, he says there is only one that is good, GOD.\n\nMark 10:18 Â And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is, God.  From King James Bible\n\n\nIf Jehovah is âthe only true God,â what kind of âGodâ is Jesus?\n\nJesus himself referred to his Father as âthe only true God.â (John 17:3) Jehovah himself said: âBesides me there is no God.â (Isa. 44:6) The apostle Paul wrote that, to true Christians, âthere is .Â .Â . one God the Father.â (1Â Cor. 8:5,Â 6) So Jehovah is unique; no one else shares his position. Jehovah stands in utter contrast to all such objects of worship as idols, deified humans, and Satan. All these are false gods.\n\nJesus is spoken of in the Scriptures as âa god,â even as âMighty God.â (John 1:1; Isa. 9:6) But nowhere is he spoken of as being Almighty, as Jehovah is. (Gen. 17:1) Jesus is said to be âthe reflection of [Godâs] glory,â but the Father is the Source of that glory. (Heb. 1:3) Jesus in no way seeks the position of his Father. He said: âIt is Jehovah your God you must worship, and it is to him alone you must render sacred service.â (Luke 4:8) He exists âin Godâs form,â and the Father has commanded that âin the name of Jesus every knee should bend,â but this is all done âto the glory of God the Father.ââPhil. 2:5-11; see also pages 212-216.\n\nDoes John 1:1 prove that Jesus is God?\n\nJohn 1:1, RS: âIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God [also KJ, JB, Dy, Kx, NAB].â NE reads âwhat God was, the Word was.â Mo says âthe Logos was divine.â AT and Sd tell us âthe Word was divine.â The interlinear rendering of ED is âa god was the Word.â NW reads âthe Word was a godâ; NTIV uses the same wording.\n\nNotice, too, how other translations render this part of the verse:\n\n1808: âand the word was a god.â The New Testament in an Improved Version, Upon the Basis of Archbishop Newcomeâs New Translation: With a Corrected Text.\n\n1864: âand a god was the word.â The Emphatic Diaglott, interlinear reading, by Benjamin Wilson.\n\n1928: âand the Word was a divine being.â La Bible du Centenaire, LâEvangile selon Jean, by Maurice Goguel.\n\n1935: âand the Word was divine.â The BibleâAn American Translation, by J.Â M.Â P.Â Smith and E.Â J.Â Goodspeed.\n\n1946: âand of a divine kind was the Word.â Das Neue Testament, by Ludwig Thimme.\n\n1950: âand the Word was a god.â New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures.\n\n1958: âand the Word was a God.â The New Testament, by James L.Â Tomanek.\n\n1975: âand a god (or, of a divine kind) was the Word.â Das Evangelium nach Johannes, by Siegfried Schulz.\n\n1978: âand godlike kind was the Logos.â Das Evangelium nach Johannes, by Johannes Schneider.\n\nWhat is it that these translators are seeing in the Greek text that moves some of them to refrain from saying âthe Word was Godâ? The definite article (the) appears before the first occurrence of theÂ·osÂ´ (God) but not before the second. The articular (when the article appears) construction of the noun points to an identity, a personality, whereas a singular anarthrous (without the article) predicate noun before the verb (as the sentence is constructed in Greek) points to a quality about someone. So the text is not saying that the Word (Jesus) was the same as the God with whom he was but, rather, that the Word was godlike, divine, a god. (See 1984 Reference edition of NW, p.Â 1579.)\n\nWhat did the apostle John mean when he wrote John 1:1? Did he mean that Jesus is himself God or perhaps that Jesus is one God with the Father? In the same chapter, verse 18, John wrote: âNo one ["

120,1,"Even though you know it was stupid to get into a fight, since she pushed you into it she could have least helped you up once it was over! \nIt sounds like she is just trying to find out if she can control you & to what extent.\n\nThere are some of out here that are nice, considerate, & good-looking. You should start looking for someone new if she keeps acting that way."
121,1,"Condescend and patronize curiously are used to explain each other: to be condescending is to speak in a patronizing manner and vice versa :O).\n\nThe difference, though, is that in condescending, one is ""descending"" to the level one perceives the other to occupy;  in patronizing, one is acting or speaking in a manner that a patron or sponsor would act, that is, like a superior in rank.\n\nSo if you speak in a way that says, ""I am adjusting my speach to accomodate the inferior mental abilities of the person I am speaking to,"" you would be condescending.\n\nIf you speak in a way that says, ""I am adjusting my speech in a way thatdemonstrates my sense of the difference in mental/educational rank between me and the other person,"" you would be patronizing."
122,1,"""Neptune makes them (Jupiter & Venus)coerce"" sounds strange at glance, becuase ""The Great One"" like Mighty God (the all-seeing one), is generally regarded as Jupiter (Zeus in ancient Greek name), greatest god in the world among Olympia's 12 gods, Roman myths.\n\nBut you know, Neptune (Poseidon)and Jupiter are both brothers, sons of Saturnus (Kronos), who was confined into the Dark becuase of he tried killing all children for fear of lost his kingdom.\n\nLike you see, to consider about this point you'll read the stanza as conflict between two powers before domination by one rule, as if actually Roman Empire's against lots of kings (as barbarians).\n\nAfter all, three worlds were divined by 3 gods, and thing not clear to me is why Venus is there.\n\nNeptune got the oceans, which means he lost. And in this stanza he was discribed as just having threatened them like extreme howling dog.\n""Waw! Only one can role with my wower (power)!"".\nAnd then his strik called to get power from the dark, I means ""time"" only evil Kronos could rule.\n\nThis is such quatrain discription.\nHe got his power when he locked out his father.\n\nYou will still keep one key terms, except Venus staring in. Number 3, of ""clock strikes three"" shows you important visiual metapher to understand it.\nWhat do you think about it? I'll give you a hint.\nHe has a spear, called ""trident"", three pronged spear, just like a fork. 3, tres, triple, trois... in that time of Roman Christian Charch, 3 means holly number, 7 as well, came from his spear, and turned into the number of judgement later, but you know originally it was used as number of Satan on the other hand. That is to say the history was written by terminating another history, in Roman myths you will find brilient re-construction to take other gods into own story as new god, or latter pushed away as diablos. Its quatrain was based on the real aspect around 4C telling about early Myths, when Roman Empire was almost collapsed.\nI think Venus's miscast also depends on such confusion, or where it come from?. What's the correct source?"

124,1,"HELL IN KJV\nOne Hebrew word âsheolâ is rendered hell. Definition; hades or the world of the dead (as if a subterranian retreat), grave, hell, pit. Three Greek words are rendered hell; geenna, hades, and tartaroo. Definition of geenna; a valley of Jerusalem, used (figuratively) as a name for the place (or state) of everlasting punishment: - hell. Definition of hades; properly unseen, that is, âHadesâ or the place (state) of departed souls: - grave, hell. Definition of tartaroo; (the deepest abyss of Hades); to incarcerate in eternal torment: - cast down to hell. Tartaroo is used only one place II Pet.2:4.\nChrist teaching the Pharisees in Luke 16:19-31 shows us a separation from God is truly what hell is. The âwaterâ is symbolic for Godâs Spirit and love. The word âtormentedâ means distressed in the Greek, not torture. The âfireâ is symbolic for the shame and desire not to be separated from God. \nSo all who die the first death of the flesh return to God Ecc.12:6-7, but on which side of the gulf do they end up?\nHell is not eternal but is done away with in Gen.20:14-15, called both the second death and lake of fire. This second death is non-existence, for death and hell and those not written in the book of life. This second death or lake of fire is like fat drippings that fall into the fire. Just a poof of smoke into non-existence.\nPsa.37:20  But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall they consume away.\nIn my mind whatâs worse yet is no memory of you, no tears will be shed for you like you never existed.\nRev.21:4 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away. \nSo hell is a separation from God and is not eternal torture or burning. Eventually hell will be done away with or passed away and also some souls. Like fat drippings in the fire, a poof of smoke into non-existence, the second death."
125,1,"It is a cedilla. But it has different functions, which depend on the language. For instance, in Portuguese, it changes the sound of ""c"" from plain ""C"" (as in ""cat"") to an approximate sound to ""s"" (as in ""satin""). In French, it has a similar function. But, as far as I know, in Romanian, for instance, it changes the sound of ""t"" from a plain ""T"" (as in ""take"") to a sound which is similar to ""sht""! Sorry, I can't remember an English word that contains a sound like that... Anyone else does?

129,1,"Valentine was a priest who served during the third century in Rome. When Emperor Claudius II decided that single men made better soldiers than those with wives and families, he outlawed marriage for young men -- his crop of potential soldiers. Valentine, realizing the injustice of the decree, defied Claudius and continued to perform marriages for young lovers in secret. When Valentine's actions were discovered, Claudius ordered that he be put to death. \nAccording to legend,Valentine actually sent the first 'valentine' greeting himself. While in prison, it is believed that Valentine fell in love with a young girl -- who may have been his jailor's daughter -- who visited him during his confinement. Before his death, it is alleged that he wrote her a letter, which he signed 'From your Valentine,'. The Carmelite Church in Dublin, Ireland claims to hold the remains of St.Valentine"

134,1,"It isnt really un christian technicly. As much as we'd like to think it is considering how vile a practice slavery is. But just as Christians finally saw the end of slavery (in America anyway) They also saw the beginning of it (Again, in America)They took it from the ancient Romans and made it so much worse. In ancient times, slaves were the people of the conquered nations of Rome, and the Romans generally treated them very well. Even making them Roman citizens after a period of time, so it was a bit like the endentured servitude of the early Americas. Christians perverted the alrady amoral practice into enslaving entire tribes for life because they felt they were ""Heathens"" and doomed to hell anyway. Although we are now much more enlightened, and most of us know that no one person is better than another, in those days they saw the slaves as inferior, which was as much a midieval prejudice as a Christian one."

137,1,"The uroborus (or ouroborus) is an ancient symbol of a snake or serpent, holding its tail in its mouth. It symbolizes unending energy, but is really a symbol of our life energy. This life energy is called Kundalini by the Eastern philosophies, whereas the West has forgotten what name it had there. But symbols survived, showing that this energy was also known in the West.\n\nOur life energy is coiled up at the end of the spine, but can rise like a serpent. It can wind up the spine, turn in the head, and move down the front of the body to the end of the spine, to again rise. Thus it forms an unending circle, as the uroborus shows.\n\nThe serpent is the ancient symbol for Kundalini life energy. When this mighty energy is forced by ambition or the ego, it can destroy the body, for the body needs to  be cleansed first before it can carry such high power energy. Therefore the evil serpent, the forced or misused life energy! Ancient Egyptian priests were not allowed to eat meat days before they entered the temple! I guess that meat, which makes the body acidic, would hinder the rise of Kundalini, which brings great wisdom and insights!\n\nThere is a book on Kundalini by Mookerjee, explaining how Kundalini works and that its normal rise had been misdiagnosed by uninitiated physicians as disease!\n\nKundalini is also mentioned in the Bible, as are all our holy energies! They are mainly mentioned in symbols, unfortunately, not understood by today's churches.\n\nCarl Jung, MD, the Swiss psychologist and student of Professor Sigmund Freud, writes about the Ouroborus in his books. He discovered that modern dreams may contain the ancient symbology of the myths!\n\nHappy discovery of more ancient wisdom!\nCordially, India.Magica"

It's long, feel like I just wrote a novel\n.\nPeople in the English-speaking world use and accept the King James or Authorized Version than any other single Bible translation. In fact, so highly esteemed is this translation that many persons venerate it as the only true Bible. This raises some questions.\n\nDo these countless persons who use the King James Version know why, despite objections from churchmen, modern translations keep rolling off the presses? Do they know why the King James Version itself was once opposed by the people? Do they know why, despite vigorous protest and opposition, the King James Version entered into the very blood and marrow of English thought and speech? Do they know what illuminating document is probably missing from their own copies? In short, do they really know the King James Version?\n\nThe purpose of Bible translation, then, is to take these thoughts of God, originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic and Greek, and put them into the common languages of today. Bible translation makes Godâs Book a living Book. So true Christians read the Bible, not to be entertained by clever turns of expression, unusual words, excellency of style, striking rhetorical devices or felicities of rhythm, but to learn the will of God. It was for this reason that the King James Version came into existence. That was in 1611.\nFrom almost every quarter the King James Bible met opposition. Criticism was often severe. Broughton, a Hebrew scholar of the day, wrote to King James that he âshould rather be torn asunder by wild horses than allow such a version to be imposed on the church.â\n\nThe translators, not unaware that people preferred to keep what had grown familiar, knew that their work had unleashed a storm. They tried to calm the people down. They wrote a âPreface of the Translatorsâ to explain why the King James Version was made. This preface is called by the Encyclopedia Americana âa most illuminating preface describing the aims of the translators which unhappily is omitted from the usual printings of the Bible.â Thus most Authorized Versions today, though they contain a lengthy dedication to King James, omit the preface. Its presence would clear up many misunderstandings about the purpose of the revision. The reader would learn that strong opposition was expected.\n\nThe reader would learn that the King James Version was a revision of earlier works made with a modest hope of improvement and no thought of finality, In time the clamor died down, and the King James Version prevailed over the Geneva Bible. For more than two and a half centuries no other so-called authorized translation of the Bible into English was made. Little wonder that many people began to feel that the King James Bible was the only true Bible. Like many people who once objected to any change in the Geneva Bible, many persons today object to any change in the King James Bible. They oppose modern translations perhaps as vigorously as the King James Version itself was once opposed.\n\nKing James Bible has already been changed; today no one reads the King James Version in its original form. Explaining why this is so the book The Bible in Its Ancient and English Versions says: âAlmost every edition, from the very beginning, introduced corrections and unauthorized changes and additions, often adding new errors in the process. The edition of 1613 shows over three hundred differences from 1611. .Â .Â . It was in the eighteenth century, however, that the main changes were made. .Â .Â . The marginal references were checked and verified, over 30,000 new marginal references were added, the chapter summaries and running headnotes were thoroughly revised, the punctuation was altered and made uniform in accordance with modern practice, textual errors were removed, the use of capitals wa"

However, since we were not ready to sleep yet (you know how these trips be), at the insistence of one of our mates, we decided to swap ghost stories. The requestor loved ghost stories but was also scared by them. Finally, one by one, we fell asleep.\n\nThe setting was right... dark night... strange place... wind howling... Our mate who had requested for the ghost stories awoke in the middle of the night, slightly disoriented. Suddenly she saw this pale figure in white walking towards her. In fright, she grabbed the hand of the person next to her... and let out a scream... for she had grabbed at nothing and the figure next to her was also in white.\n\nWhat actually happened was that one of our clasmates sleep walked. Her white night dress and the moonlight gave her a ghostly effect. Also, her neighbour had covered herself completely with a white bedsheet. The combined effect left our mate thinking she had seen two ghosts! \n\nThis story went down in the annals of our class as the funniest ghost story ever. Hope you enjoyed it too. :)"

182,1,"I actually do believe that a small percentage of pedophiles are that way due to sexual orientation.  I heard a radio interview with a therapist recently.  About 10% of child molesters are only attracted to children.  But for the other 90% it is more about power and psychological problems.  The 10% who are that way by orientation need to be kept permanently away from children.  The rest can be rehabilitated, and there are good, proven treatment programs to do this, but it is not fast, might take a couple or three years, and it does cost money.  I feel very sorry for people who can't help but be attracted to children by orientation (the 10% of molesters) but if they cannot controlthemselves from acting on it, then the protection of children from that kind of harm is more important than their freedom.  I agree that there are probably many who never act on their feelings of attraction to children (pedophiles by orientation but never molest children).  This is my opinion."

They aren't corrupted.  And the reason there are so many versions is because the entire Bible was put together in segments of Greek and Hebrew.  They were translated by different people.  However, you'll find that the basic meanings of the verses, what they were meant to say, are the same.  The NIV, NKJV are two that I use and there isn't much of a difference."

189,1,"Actually, christian dating, or courtship is biblical, if not somewhat overlooked by today's general population because of it's cry for purity and virginity. Someone mentioned polygamy and adultery in the old testament. Duh. People were human then too, but that didn't make their actions correct, nor can we base our personal lives and ok our actions on the sins of others.\n The story of Isaac and Rebecca in the old Testament is a great example. The wife was chosen in good taste by the parents for Isaac. Both Isaac and Rebecca had a voice as to whether or not they liked the other one. In the end, they were married, and they were pure!!!!!!! Yes, I belive in biblical courtship. Their is a good book, (Let the Bible be your first authority), on courting vs. dating. It is called ""I KIssed Dating Goodbye"" by Joshua Harris. No, I don't believe everything he believes, but he does have many good standards. \nI believe that you don't have to wear a veil over your face to be pure, nor, must you be amish. Purity starts in the mind and in the heart. \nSo, in conclusion, yes, I believe in dating biblically."

I sat around eating cold pizza for about half an hour, then saw (and shot) my first deer.  I ran victoriously over to the dead animal, cheering inside over my victory, but then, as soon as I grabbed it by the legs, and started dragging it out of the brush, I became aware of the fact that this had been a living creature.

As he grew, Samuel became âmore likable both from Jehovahâs standpoint and from that of men.â\n\nBecomes Prophet at an Early Age. At night Samuel slept in âthe temple of Jehovah, where the ark of God was,â and his first assignment in the morning appears to have been to open âthe doors of Jehovahâs house.â \n\nLeads Israel in True Worship. Over 20 years later, at Samuelâs exhortation, the Israelites abandoned idolatrous worship and began serving Jehovah alone. \n\nThe days of Samuel brought additional reverses for the Philistines  and proved to be a period marked by outstanding Passover celebrations.  Samuel also seems to have worked out some arrangement for the Levite gatekeepers, and his arrangement may have served as a basis for the organization put into operation by David. \n\nAnoints Saul as King. The unfaithfulness of Samuelâs sons, coupled with the threat of warfare with the Ammonites, prompted the older men of Israel to request that Samuel appoint a king over them. \n\nAnoints David. \n\nSamuel died as an approved servant of Jehovah God after a lifetime of faithful service.  He had demonstrated persistence in fulfilling his commission, devotion to true worship, honesty in his dealings, and courage and firmness in announcing and upholding Jehovahâs judgments and decisions"

They are NOT related in any ways to the Roman Catholic Church.  The Amish people, as mistakenly named as the Penn. Dutch, are actually Germans.  They call all Non-Amish as ""English"" whilst using their own dialect of German language within their own circles.\n\nThey are very religious with their own interpretation of the Christian Bible.  They believe in marrying one's own cousins is justified with their interpretation of the Bible.  They do not like modern technologies which they view as temptations and/or source of Satan's Evil."

I'm sure the local gov't. doesn't want a bunch of religious loonies clambering around in their mountains, leaving trash everywhere and trying to find some non-existent boat. Of course, that doesn't stop Christians from believing any old thing they read about it.\n\nPlease, people, for once, think about the logistics of it. A boat that huge, made entirely of wood, COULD NOT survive an ocean voyage--it would collapse under its own weight, to say nothing of tons of cargo!  You cannot fit thousands upon thousands of animals onto a ship that size. There was almost no ventilation, except for tiny windows up at the top. Hello, FUMES, ANYONE?? Could 8 people keep up with the crap from thousands of animals? Where was it disposed of? Where did they keep food for that many animals? \n\nWhat about plant life? No, most seeds do not survive brackish water.  What about the fish? With few exceptions, they are adapted to either fresh or salt water, not both. \n\nWhat about animals that are so highly adapted to a specific environment that they die if taken out of it? Everglade kites feed exclusively on a specific type of snail, for which their beaks are adapted perfectly. Where did Noah get both the kites AND the snails?? Koalas and eucalyptus trees? Pandas and bamboo? Hummingbirds and various trumpet-shaped flowers?  Roadrunners and lizards? Egg-eating snakes and the eggs they feed on? Vultures and carrion? And then, how did he get them all back where they belong?  Good grief, this story is so silly that I can't believe anyone in the 21st century still takes it literally."

Now in this verse from the heights of divine glory we come back again to this sorry earth,with its base idolatries.We are asked to""look at this picture(the signs of Allah)and at the later"" The three principal idols of pagan Arab idolatry were the goddess""Lat"" ""Uzza"",and""Manat"".Basically if understood correctly it means that how can anyone deny the clear signs of Allah and worship idols like that.\n\n    the thing you have written under this verse\n\n   ""THESE ARE THE EXALTED FEMALES\nMOUNTING NEARER AND NEARER TO ALLAH.""\n\n i don't understand where this came from...its is not in the Quran anywhere,,neither in any book of prophet Muhammad(peace be upon him) sayings called HADITH...these lines are fabricated and have nothing to do with Allah ,his messenger(peace be upon him)and Islam.\n\nnow the Sura 16 ,,is called ""Nahl"" and the verse 103 reads as follows\n   ""And We know well that they say: Only a man teacheth him.

He probably feels worse than you do right now and he might even be thinking be that he did lead you on in some way.  \n\nThe only thing I can say is that the longer you wait to talk to him again the more ackward things are going to be.  The sooner you get things out in the open and talk about it, the quicker everything will go back to normal.\n\nI'm bi and I actually had a similar expirience with a friend of mine who was gay.  We use to work together and he was always touchy feely; I assumed maybe he was bi like me... needless to say I was wrong.  (Even though I now know he is as gay as gay can be, he's got this thing with boobs lol, which I guess all guys do.)  \n\nI felt stupid for a long time but I didn't want my misunderstanding to affect things between us.  We talked about it and I realized that it wasn't an option to be his lover but ""friends"" aren't bad either.  I knew that keeping him as a friend meant I wouldn't lose him and losing him was the last thing that I wanted to happen.\n\nEverything is fine now and we're still really good friends.  Don't think that you're the first girl to fall for a gay guy because that's not true at all.  You get a man with the caring part of a woman... all straight ladies want that!!!  Just talk to him and let him know that no matter what you're going to continue to be there for him just as he will be there for you."
275,1,"I've always found it is best to go to the prospective employer in person with printed out resume in hand.  Try to see the Human Resources dept/manager rather than handing it to the receptionist at the front desk.  Always dress smartly even if it's just for a minimum wage job.  And last bit of advice is to try and research the company a little bit before you apply, that way if you do get an interview you can show just how serious you really are about working there.

We are obedient to the laws set by the government, but we are nuetral when it comes to politics. We didn't change the bible to fit our religion because if you read the king james version along with the new world translation you see they say the same things, the new world translation is written in a way to be better understood. If we changed it then we wouldn't be following in Jesus footsteps because he would never change Jehovah Gods message to fit his purpose.We believe all scriptures are inspired by God as brought out in 2 Timothy 3:16 even though it was written by man.We believe that when someone dies no matter if the person is a witness or not life does not continue anywhere else as brought out in Ecclesiastes 9:5,10. We also believe that while the bible is a guidline some scriptures describe symbolic accounts as examples and learning tools. We don't think we're perfect but we try to live in harmony with what we're taught from the bible. Yes we believe only a set number(144,000) go to heaven as brought out in Revelation 7:4-10 and the ones who do not have a hope of going to heaven will live on earth which is brought out in Psalms 37:29, 115:16 Matthew 5:5. We have meetings three days a week and we attend conventions and assemblies every year. We attend the memorial of Jesus death as directed in Luke 22:14-19 once a year.Feel free to ask me any other questions or any witness for that matter, we'll be happy to answer them."

296,1,"ANYONE can be called, the choice is up to us. However, we must believe and if we truly believe then we will follow the commands He set down for us. Belief takes more then intellectual knowledge, belief is action and knowledge working together. Simply acknowledging God is not belief, even Satan and his demons believe there is a God and that Jesus is His Son. You believe by hearing the Word, Romans 10:17 So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.\n\nJeremiah 29:11-14 \n11 For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the LORD, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope. 12 Then you will call upon Me and go and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. 13 And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart. 14 I will be found by you, says the LORD, and I will bring you back from your captivity; I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I have driven you, says the LORD, and I will bring you to the place from which I cause you to be carried away captive.\n\nMany claim to be Christians and many think they are, but only a small amount truly are Christians. When you truly seek God with your heart and you follow His commands then you will understand.\nLuke 10:22-25 (New International Version)\n 22""All things have been committed to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."" \n23Then he turned to his disciples and said privately, ""Blessed are the eyes that see what you see. 24For I tell you that many prophets and kings wanted to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it.""\nI am reading the same Bible I was reading before I became a true Christian, but it is vastly different when I read the words.

It is you who will benefit by the knowledge of God's kingdom and His purpose and will in your life.

I don't know which version you use, but I suggest you visit a local Christian book store and look through the many versions to find the one you understand the most clearly.  I prefer the Zondervan New International  Version Study Bible, but my husband prefers the New King James Version.  \n\nBefore you read the Bible, you should always ask that God open your eyes to the meaning and understanding of what you are reading.  Nothing will stop you from reading the bible quicker than not being able to understand it.\n\nFinally, have a plan to read it.  Most Bibles have a one year reading plan in them that includes daily readings from both the Old and New Testaments.  And do not be afraid to ask trusted Christians what a verse means.

""Oh you're so funny. Lol."" You can also say Lawl, Lollerskates, lool, kik. Don't ask why, people just assume those are kewl. Other forms of laughter can include ""ROFL"" Which is ""rolling on the floor laughing"" Or ""LMAO"" Which is ""laughing my ass off"". Could also always just say ""Hehe"" ""haha"". \n\n- Shortening words.. for example ""Seriously"" can either become ""Srsly."" Or ""Serially."" Again, don't ask why, people think it's kool.\n\n- Don't ask ASL anymore. ASL is so ghey. It means you're a horny bastard lookin' for some sorry cyb0rg seckz to give you more of a reason to touch yourself. Not cool. Just simply ask when you're curious.. ""Oh, where do you live btw?"" ""And how old are you?"" People tend to play it off as if those certain facts don't matter because they're not internet predators looking for cyb0rgz, but rather a nice conversation with whomever.\n\n- FTW. It's the newest acronym that I know of. I think it's pretty ghey, but other people like it. ""For the win"" is what it means. You usually say it after you've made a comment that defeats the previous comment relevant to topic. Say it's favorite cereal.. and someone says Froot loops.. you'd then proceed to say ""Cinnamon Toast CRUNK, ftw."" And thus.. you've pwned them.\n\n- Pwn is to ""own"" as in, defeat someone to silence.. usually when your witty remark has bested theirs. Pwning is something you should be proud of. How proud? As proud as someone could be for winning an intranet argument.\n\nThe rest is simply using the English language.. using too much internet lingo makes you look like a retard, so just stick to the above.\n\nOh.. don't forget the emotion icons.. or shall we say..

When they get older, we'll have to see if they want to use Mom for one or both of us and let them decide what they like. \n\nChidlren who grow up in same sex households just get used to being specific when they're calling their parents.  It really is the least of one's problems with same sex parenting."

307,1,"Languages are learnt by absorbing it's dialects by the subconcious mind. When you learn a language when you are grown up it is harder to learn it. The same language would have been learnt easily had it been learnt in childhood. For example , if you begin to learn chinese it is extremely difficult when you are grown up as your concious mind interferes with the learning process but have you noticed that the chinese children have mastered it since their early years? The same Logic holds true for all languages.\n\nNow coming to the central point of using a language. This is governed by your mood & your requirement of Communicating. The best of the best speakers communicating in many languages  ALWAYS curse , use unusable words in THEIR MOTHER TONGUE. But when it comes to meeting their needs they revert to what will benefit them the most. For example ,according to your moods, governed by the subconcious partly residing in the Right brain you will pass comments on a woman/man you have a crush on, in a language she/he won't understand in a Public place. So you can see that the usage of language is governed by your mind especially the subconcious."

310,1,"Because in Islam, the children take on the faith of the father. And the woman is charged with raising the children. And in this scenario, it's feared that the woman will teach the children of another faith, and lose her faith in Islam while she attempts to do so.\n\nin Judaism, children take the Mother's faith. hence, a Jewish person would  remain Jewish even though he/she converted to another religion. \n\n(different Laws>> new covenant)"
311,1,"I am a Christian and I have found remarkable facts that have bolstered my faith in Intelligent Design. To name one, Irreducable Complexity. It is the fact, (Not Theory) that the simplest cell in our body was created completely in a moment's time, instead of a gradual evolution. It is like a mouse trap. There's a board, spring, lever, and latch. The cell, like the trap, has components that compliment each other in the same way the trap does. If you took one component away the trap would be defective, likewise if the cell is left without all the necessary systems it will perish leaving no time for evolution."

Would we still search for meaning?  True happiness would be a realm where we ceased to suffer.  If we are not continually intellectually and emotionally satisfied then we suffer, no matter what the setting."
315,1,I found you some websites to read up on.\nMaybie you could go to some christian/catholic schools where they still have prayer and ask if you could interview students or teachers on how prayer has effected them at school.

317,1,First off I don't believe the Bible was the first book man saw since books were printed. As far as the dead sea scrolls many Christians and Jews believe them of course as they should because they are some of the oldest known writings in their religion. There are many other books and manuscripts written for other religions. As for as God stop telling man what to write down for him. Maybe it was because man just couldn't get it right. Maybe that's why he wrote the ten commandments himself. Then man went and lost the damn ark so we no longer have that. The ten commandments we have now is just something man wrote down for God. We don't know if man got it right or not since they lost the Ark with Gods written ten commandments inside. It's only fair to tell you I am an Atheist but a Christian Atheist of course. Kisses Betty
318,1,My mom.
319,1,"Good question. Made me think. Jesus brought with him the spirit of the laws of how mankind should live, not the word of the law. He wasn't atheist but in a way you could say he was more human-oriented than any of the prophets before him. \n\nHe said himself that he did not come to undo the law and the prophets, yet the simple philosophy of doing to your neighbor what you would have him do to you was enough to change the Jewish customs dramatically into Christianity.\n\nHe wasn't atheist, but I think you mean that his teachings work outside the context of religion. He advocated doing what makes sense no matter what the law said. He healed on the sabbath, he drank wine, he taught people who were not Jews the same as people who were. He was a revolutionary. I can see how one could ask this question."

325,1,"There is a very fine line between both terms:\n\nBoth, overall, indicate someone who believes they are a different sex than they were born into.\n\nClassically though, transgendered meant someone who feels they're in the wrong body but just acts the opposite sex or desires to be the opposite sex. Transsexual referred to someone who surgically or chemically undergoes changes to be more like the opposite sex.\n\nOr alternatively, someone who feels they fall between sexes but don't feel discretly male or female.\n\nAs simplistic as the above is, the issue is compondounded further because the terms are used interchangably. Some refer to both classes as transgendered, feeling the need to remove the ""sex"" reference in the name, but there are transgendered people that don't feel they fit the category of transsexual, ie, they do not wish to change sexes.\n\nOn the flipside, some transsexuals reject the transgendered term all-together.\n\nWikipedia has an excellent article when it comes to trying to differentiate between transgendered and transsexualism, but in the end, it means slightly different things to different people."

328,1,"Our alphabet is Greek-Latin, not -Latino.\nThe reason it is called ""Western"" culture is that all the disparate, separate elements that make it up came together to make a distinct culture in western Europe starting in about the 16th century AD.

It marked a rebirth of learning, science, and rationality following the religious and political oppressiveness of the Medieval period, a/k/a the ""Dark Ages."""
329,1,"Godsman,\n\nMy father was a Baptist minister, so I grew up in church. About 12 years ago, I was âbaptized in the Spirit.â That is what makes me âPentecostal.â The Holy Spirit first came on the day of Pentecost, and so we are called âPentecostalâ because we believe that the Christian experience and practice should be the same now as at the beginning. \n\nThe rules I follow are:\n\nLove God with all my heart, soul, mind and strength.\nLove my neighbor as myself.\nThe Great Commission: to go into all the world and make disciples\n\nAs a âPentecostal,â the âbaptism in the Holy Spirit,â healing, speaking in tongues and all the other practices of the early church are important to me. Many feel that the early church was inaugurated by miracles and signs and wonders, and then they faded away, but I feel they are just as possible and just as necessary today.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nGod bless."

348,1,"Happy,\n\nThe Muslims that I met in the Middle East were just people. Some are nice and some are not. Religion is not practiced strictly by most people, but is more like a club that helps them socially and in business. There are repressive governments, and it is difficult for an American to tolerate the abuses of freedom in those countries.\n\nThere is a Muslim âproblemâ that is obvious to anyone. In Sudan, the Arab Muslims tried for 20 years to wipe out all Christians and killed many and destroyed lives, churches, homes, etc. Today they are engaged in trying to kill the black Muslims in the Darfur region of the country. Hundreds of thousands are being killed and the increasing violence has left hundreds of thousands of civilians in Darfur without food, and facing the prospect of widespread disease and death within weeks.\n\nThe conflict between Arab Muslims and black Muslims has already killed an estimated 300,000 in the past two years and has left nearly two million people homeless. Most of the refugees have fled for their lives into neighboring Chad. Raids by rebel groups along the border have raised the threat level and the possibility of all out war between Sudan and Chad.\n\nCaught in the middle are the black Muslim men, women, and children in refugee camps spread out along the border. The Sudanese government has used militia known as the Janjaweed to unleash a campaign of murder, rape, arson, and looting against these black Muslims just like they did against the Christians.\n\nThe recent raids by the Janjaweed have caused some in the refugee camps to flee back into Darfur, a region with active genocide. It is the first genocide of the 21st century as the Sudanese government is directly pursuing the murder of millions of their countrymen.\n\nI donât understand the murder of 3,000 innocent Americans in 2001, but at least one might argue that we have differing cultures and religions. In Sudan, the Arab Muslims are trying to destroy the black Muslims who share the same religion. It is a very troubling religion that espouses that kind of violence.\n\nAs I said, I met some very nice Muslims in the Middle East, and so I admit that Iâm confused about the violence against innocent people in the name of Islam. The really bad places in the Middle East are the countries where the religion is in charge of the government.\n\nIn the dark ages, the Catholic Church was as bad or worse when they were in charge of governments. Thatâs why our founding fathers were so determined to preclude the church from any controlling interest in our government.\n\nFreedom is great, and most Americans are naÃ¯ve concerning the way the rest of the world lives. Everyone should take a trip to the Middle East or South America or Asia at least once in their lifetime to appreciate how good it really is here.\n\nGod bless."
349,1,"Your reasoning does not necessarily follow. \n\nConsider one of the suppositions that some scientists have posited as a possible conclusion to the unknowable state of subatomic particles posited by Quantum theory: every choice may spin off a new universe. \n\nNow - mind you - I am not positing that this is what happens, but some serious people have proposed this - every choice you can make, some iteration of you does make, since thought itself is quite possibly quantum mechanical (it is passed via electrons, so the possibility cannot be precluded.) And each of these choices spins a new thread off the universe into a multiverse of possible outcomes. \n\nAs you can see, this is just one possible means by which you actually can have complete control of your destiny, and for God to still know the outcome. An infinite God would still be God of a multiverse of infinite possibility.\n\nYour choices are yours. You know you make them. You can feel yourself make them, as you make them - I don't need to prove this, anyone reading can intuit for themselves that I am telling a basic truth.\n\nThe fact that God does have some inkling of how all this will turn out does not represent any sort of interference with your free will. Nor is it a disproof of God. It is merely a reflection that an infinite wisdom can consider infinite possibilities, and find any of them to be quite unsurprising.\n\nSo no - while God is self-limiting in the sense that he does not appear to want to interfere in our doings (and the universe appears to have been explicitly designed to permit free will) - this is not an argument for God's powerlessness or non-existence. It is proof only that, if there is a God, infinite choices and possibilities are not out of reach of his infinite power."
350,1,"The best thing to do is to tell the person who has the item that someone else needs that another person needs it. Borrowing without permission is the same as stealing. Probably it wouldn't make a difference if it were stolen, but lending it to someone else is entrapping the person you lent it to as an accessory to a theft. \n\nBe on the level. \n\nI don't know about how relevant Karma is in this situation. Stealing is stealing. And borrowing without permission is stealing. Just be honest and do the right thing and Karma will not be an issue."

352,1,"No, I own my own business and am obviously older than you.\n\nFirst, study your history.\nBlack slaves were more physically capable than whites or Indians and quickly replaced both in agriculture which demanded hard, manual labor under bad conditions. No other group as a race was as strong and productive. Without them, the South would not have benefitted from a strong cotton and sugar industry. The North that bought these products and processed them would not have been as productive either. It was only when the south threatened to go directly to Europe where prices were cheaper than the more expensive North that the slavery issue became a galvenizing force for the North to attack the more rural and agricultural south. There were still slaves in the North during this conflict so it was not just riteous indignation that spawned the liberation of the blacks.\n\nAfter the war, many blacks continued to work on the farms where they had worked their whole lives. Life was much more difficult then and it has only been in the last 100 years or so that most of our population lives in cities.\n\nAfter the war, it took all of us time to heal. Blacks, Southerners, Northerners, etc. Blacks still helped rebuild the South after the war.\n\nNow, we have a huge population that lives in cities. As a whole, I cannot definitively say that blacks are equal to the other races in productivity. Many of their decendents were brought here for their physical attributes and they have been surpressed after the war as well.\n\nI think that we are now at a cross roads. Blacks, as a race, probably have more rights than whites but have not been allowed to complete a transition that can take decades.\n\nI think most people would appreciate it if you would learn more about history and not feel so cormfortable sitting at your computer and spreading racism. You are being more lazy and hateful than those you attack.\n\nUndoubtedly, your stupid comments have hurt and alienated a good many people of all nationalities. So start using Yahoo for something productive because right now, I think America's economy would be much better off without people like you, no matter what race you are!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

358,1,"very very interesting concept. The need to seem/appear more affluent is something that society places alot of emphasis on. Throughout history, people with more money, fame, possessions have been given higher importance. And dependant on your possessions and financial stance, people will view you in a different way, and many times, tend to believe that the person is better. Personally, I feel that the only way a person can be judged, if even, is by his personality, his compassion, his humanity, his honor and his righteousness. In short, deeds-- good deeds and pure intention is perhaps the only fair way to sub categorize people..  But coming back to what you were saying, its sad that there is this human tendency to seem bigger, bigger and/or richer than we actually are. Its the reason why so many people are in debt, and the bank and loan companies are reveling in the joys of our falls.  I do admit that there are times, that people dont purchase things because they want to seem more affluent in society, and its just because they want something so bad, and they want to pay it off in installments. In that case, my best advice would be to get zero % interest type deals, where you don't lose out in the long run, get your favorite ""toy"" or product or useful necessary item, and just pay it off responsibly. The dangers lie when greed take over caution, and one spends way over what one could make up for, leading him/her into financial chaos, and paying off thousands of dollars of interest for a long long time.  In the long run, more things do not ultimately buy happiness.. We know that. A nice warm living area, safety, health, thoughts of God's mercy, and a compassionate outlook on life should suffice."

Meaningless!"" \n       says the Teacher. \n       ""Utterly meaningless! \n       Everything is meaningless."" \n\n 3 What does man gain from all his labor \n       at which he toils under the sun? \n\n 4 Generations come and generations go, \n       but the earth remains forever. \n\n 5 The sun rises and the sun sets, \n       and hurries back to where it rises. \n\n 6 The wind blows to the south \n       and turns to the north; \n       round and round it goes, \n       ever returning on its course. \n\n 7 All streams flow into the sea, \n       yet the sea is never full. \n       To the place the streams come from, \n       there they return again. \n\n 8 All things are wearisome, \n       more than one can say. \n       The eye never has enough of seeing, \n       nor the ear its fill of hearing. \n\n 9 What has been will be again, \n       what has been done will be done again; \n       there is nothing new under the sun. \n\n 10 Is there anything of which one can say, \n       ""Look! This is something new""? \n       It was here already, long ago; \n       it was here before our time. \n\n 11 There is no remembrance of men of old, \n       and even those who are yet to come \n       will not be remembered \n       by those who follow.\nThe word abide has a slight range of meaning.**abide by : to act or behave in accordance with or in obedience to**\nIt helps to have the context. This passage is an emotional cry. The author is realizing his insignificance and compares his temporal life on Earth to the age and lawfulness of the Earth. This understanding is essential to saving faith. Try reading it again and try to identify with the writer."

383,1,Congratulations!  There are no Gods... but many of us applaud you for being so active in exploring the possibilities.
384,1,Catholicism is a branch of Christianity.  Not believing in the Bible defeats the purpose of Christianity.  You can't claim to be a Christian yet not believe in the one book that Christianity is all about.
385,1,There are none. Simply the truth.
386,1,"Great question.  I totally agree with your question.  Jesus is the light of the world.  When that light shines on me when I sometimes lose my temper or when I get frustrated, it reminds me of the cross.  Jesus is worthy of all praise.  I am not worthy of any praise.  Jesus makes me worthy when I stand in His light.\n\nThe closer we are to Jesus the more we see our failings.  The more that we see our failings we realize how redeemed we really are.  I don't think there is any religion out there that can leave a person with such hope to press on than Christianity.  When I turn to Jesus I don't see a foot waiting to crush me.  I see a hand reaching to help me up.  This revelation is part of maturing.  Maturing is pressing on to perfection.\n\nGod Bless."

389,1,"You don't have to be baptized to go to heaven, you have to get SAVED...that means you need to put your faith and trust in Jesus to forgive you and repent of your sins. Baptism is merely an outward expression that you've chosen to live for HIM..it is something that you should do, but it's not necessary to go to heaven."
390,1,"I think children should have the right to choose. I am biracial as well and I used to get very upset about having to choose, because I felt like no matter which box I checked, I would be ignoring one half of me! I always vowed that when I grew older, I would do something that would grant me the power to change these things. Even though I may be kinda off that track now, I do greatly appreciate the ""check all that apply"" boxes. \n\nIn general however, when it says to only check one box, I do check black or African American. Why? Because I feel like that side of me is historically known to be more accepting - ""black"" is so diverse. If you check a box that says white but you don't look it, someone is bound to say something hurtful. That's just how I see it. Just to make the point, I LOVE BOTH SIDES!!"
391,1,"As a child the chandelier used to swing from side to side, and the radio would turn on by itself in the middle of the night.\n\nOne time on a camping trip I was walking back from the bathrooms at that moment right between day and night and I saw someone walk across the front of the site and stop behind a tree. So I figure one of the people is going to jump out and try to surprise me, so I pull out my flashlight, walk up to the tree, turn on the light, and there's no one there.\n\nOne time I was alone in a house, and I felt a presence. I looked at a mobile hanging motionless, and said, ""If there is anyone else here, make the mobile spin."" The next moment, the mobile began to spin.\n\nOne time I was driving into Ponca State Park to set up a large camping gathering, and the sides of the road were lined with spirits. All standing there, clearly visible to everyone, calmly welcoming us back.\n\nOn another camping trip, we felt a spirit near the bon-fire. We had a ring of 40 tiki-torches around the bonfire. It was a still and windless night, but all the tiki flames near the spirit bent in. One of the people in the circle had a fancy camera. After the campout she went to get the film developed, and all the photos from before the visitor turned out, but after that all the film was blank. She took the camera in to be repaired. The repairman asked if she'd been in a nuclear power plant. All the innards were fried from electromagnetism\n\nMy grandmother died while my niece was in utero. After my niece was born, she would look up at areas where no one was standing, and laugh and giggle. We all knew that she was looking at gramma, so we never showed her any pictures. Finally, at about a year old, she could speak, and my sister showed her the family photo album. My niece picked out her photo and said, ""That's Old Gramma."""

393,1,"I'm not sure I understand your question.\nDo you mean that, ""If ""bananas"", a never-before seen or imagined item suddenly appeared out of thin air, then Athiests would believe that these bananas came from monkeys""?\n\nIf so, then I would answer by saying that very rarely (if ever) do new objects suddenly appear from no source. (This does happen on a sub-atomic level, but only to certain particles and certainly not to ""bananas"") \n\nIf, someday something were to materialize from nowhere, it would be illogical to assume that the entire Athiest community would throw up their hands and declare, ""The monkeys did it!"" More reasonably, they would study the ""bananas"" and if after many trials, the ""bananas"" were not identified to have come from anywhere, they would probably classify ""bananas"" as a new type of ""super-material"" and leave it for future generations to ponder.\n\nIn regards to your question about proving the non-existance of such ""bananas"", that would be easy. All you have to do is show that ""bananas"" appeared recently. Then you could easily say that because no ""bananas"" existed before the date they first appeared, they must not have existed then. In other words, the current existence of the ""bananas"" is proof that they didn't exist then.\n\nIf I misunderstood your question I am sorry, please disregard my answer."
394,1,"Hmm... I think it really depends on what kind of guy did it. If it's a popular guy, maybe he is flirting with you? If you don't think so, comfront him directly or just give him a cold stare. \n\nIf it's a more unpopular guy, he could also be flirting. Also bring it up directly, but you could do it publicly and, if he is relitively unpopular, most people will be on your side. Hopefully, it will stop. I hope that helps.\n\n~MMT~\n\nP.S- Good luck finding the guy"
395,1,"The terms D-Day and H-Hour are used for the day and hour on which a combat attack or operation is to be initiated. They designate day and hour for an operation when the actual day and hour have not yet been determined or announced. The letters are derived from the words for which they stand, ""D"" for the day of the invasion and ""H"" for the hour the operation actually begins. When used in combination with figures and plus or minus signs, these terms indicate the length of time preceding or following a specific action. Thus, H-3 means 3 hours before H-hour, and D+3 means 3 days after D-day. H+75 minutes means H-hour plus 1 hour and 15 minutes. Planning papers for large-scale operations are made up in detail long before, specific dates are set. Phased orders are planned for execution on D-Day or H-Hour minus or plus a certain number of days, hours, or minutes. According to the U.S. Army's Center of Military History, the earliest known use of these terms is in Field Order Number 9, First Army, American Expeditionary Forces. It is dated September 7, 1918: ""The first Army will attack at H hour on D day with the object of forcing the evacuation of the St. Mihiel Salient."" D-Day for the invasion of Normandy was set for June 5, 1944, but it actually occurred on June 6. Therefore, D-Day, as it applies to Overlord, is June 6, 1944."

399,1,"The word Scientology literally means ""the study of truth."" It comes from the Latin word ""scio"" meaning ""knowing in the fullest sense of the word"" and the Greek word ""logos"" meaning ""study of."" \n\nScientology is the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself, others and all of life. The Scientology religion comprises a body of knowledge extending from certain fundamental truths. Prime among these: \n\nMan is an immortal, spiritual being. His experience extends well beyond a single lifetime. His capabilities are unlimited, even if not presently realized â and those capabilities can be realized. He is able to not only solve his own problems, accomplish his goals and gain lasting happiness, but also achieve new, higher states of awareness and ability. \n\nIn Scientology no one is asked to accept anything as belief or on faith. That which is true for you is what you have observed to be true. An individual discovers for himself that Scientology works by personally applying its principles and observing or experiencing results. \n\nThrough Scientology, people all over the world are achieving the long-sought goal of true spiritual release and freedom"

401,2,"I found no reference to ""inertial motion.""  Did you mean inertial mass (m)?  There is also the concept of motion in an inertial frame; perhaps that's what you meant.  [See source.]\n\nAn inertial mass is simply one that fits into the equation F = ma.  (There is also a gravitational mass that fits into W = mg; where W is weight and g is the acceleration due to gravity.  Einstein claims the two masses are equivalent.)  Because F = ma has been proved over and over again, even in high school labs, I think it's safe to say that m does exist.\n\nThe conservation of energy and of momentum laws are two major uses of inertial mass.  These two laws have been proved over and over again; this also validates the concept of inertial mass."

403,2,"Passivation accomplishes two things.  First, it removes any stray particles of mild steel that may be present on the surface of the stainless steel.  Second, it builds a protective layer of corrosion on the surface of the stainless steel by slightly corroding the stainless steel itself.  \n\nThis process is desirable when the steel will be subjected to harsh environments, such as submersion or heavy exposure to seawater."

405,2,"This is called Chimera. After the mythological beast which had body parts of different sets of animals.\nA Chimera will usually have their blood and tissue of one DNA, while their reproductive organs and some inner organs will be of another. This is fairly random as to the ""where"" and ""what,"" and it usually comes up as a concern in DNA testing when a mother is seemingly not the parent of her child. Or in crime cases where they cannot identify the rapist based on semen.\nThis condition occurs when two twins are begining to form within the womb, and for whatever reason one twin dies--and the other cell takes on the DNA--as a ""clean up"" if you will. The result is that the one cell finds no reason not to use the perfectly good DNA, and incorporates both wherever it sees fit."

411,2,"Diffusion is simply the movement of molecules from a place where they are in high concentration to a place where their concentration is lower. It occurs when the system is not in equilibrium.\nOsmosis is a special type of diffusion that happens through a membrane; when the membrane separates two solutions with different concentration of a substance, and the molecules of that substance cannot go through the membrane, then water molecules are the ones that do the moving until equilibrium is reached again."

414,2,"When in the bottle or can the solution is in equilibrium with the partial pressure of C02 equal to the pressure in the can. When the can is opened the pressure in the can drops (the ffffft or hiss sound you hear) and now the partial pressure of C02 in the soda solution is greater than the atmospheric pressure. This results in C02 coming out of solution, which causes bubbles to form. The bubbles represent a separate phase, which is a heterogeneous mixture rather than the homogeneous mixture prior to opening.\nNote that the CO2 levels does not completely equilibrate upon opening. Once the solution has come nearly to equilibrium (re CO2), the soda is said to have 'gone flat' and is no longer fizzy.\n\nI'm not sure the presence of oxygen has anything to do with this phenomenon."

423,2,"One of the most simple requirements for tiling: if a polygon tiles a plane, then in each of polygon vertexes on the plane, the sum of adjacent angles should equal 360 degrees (one of the angles may be a side of another polygon, making up 180 degrees). \n\nFor example, imagine or draw a ""house-shaped"" pentagon, that is a square with a right-angled triangle on top (right angle pointing up). It has two angles of 90 degrees at the bottom, two 135 degree angles where ""walls"" and ""roof"" meet, and a 90 degree angle at the top (""roof"" tip). You can tile them side-by-side and then tile the same pentagons on top, flipped upside down. At the ""tip of the roof"", you will see that two 135 degree angles and one 90 degree angle meet. 135+135+90=360. If it would not be the case, there would be a crack in the tiling.\n\nHowever, some polygons have such angle values that it is impossible to make a sum of angles equal to 360 or 180 degrees. For example, consider regular pentagons. They have angles of 108 degrees. However you add up 108 degree angles, you cannot make up 360 or 180."

425,2,"Auroras are rapidly shifting patches and streams of coloured lights appearing in the night sky, usually in winter and usually at latitudes above 60Â° north or south. In the northern hemisphere this phenomenon is called aurora borealis; in the southern hemisphere it is called aurora australis. Auroras occur when charged particles in the solar wind interact with gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Seen from space, auroras have a characteristic ring shape.\n\n\nThe electrons and protons penetrate the magnetosphere of the Earth and enter the lower Van Allen radiation belt, overloading it. The excess electrons and protons are discharged into the atmosphere over an area centring on the north and south magnetic poles and extending about 20Â° from them. These particles then collide with gas molecules in the atmosphere, thereby exciting the molecules and causing luminescence, the emission of visible light."

There is only one way to be identical, so there are billions or trillions way for them to be different, so what are the odds that two would be equal?  Very low, so low it is virtually zero.\nAs for the symmetry, the condition that makes the flakes grow is that additional molecules of water add to the existing crystal as a function of what conditions exist; and since flakes are small, the conditions are nearly identical around the flake, hence it will tend to grow symmetrically.  But what about a snow flake right besides the first one?  Shouldn't it be growing similarly to its neighbor and thus be identical? Yes, provide that the starting crystal formed at the same moment, and with the same angle (as snow flakes are flat, that means the way they will grow depend on their angle as a function of time). Again the chance two flakes will start growing at the same time, and are at the same angle is essentially non-existent."

London dispersion forces are relatively weak and exponentially dependent on the distance between atoms- so they must be relatively close to one another."

It took hours to find the answer, and being an amateur astronomer, I'm very happy to know the answer now. :)\n\nMyCn = Mayall/Cannon (of Annie Jump Cannon and Margaret W. Mayall) ...however I'm not sure exactly of what the 18 represents.\n\n""Mayall Cannon 18 is the designation for the Hourglass Nebula. The source is a catalog of faint stars. It was the work of Annie Jump Cannon and Margaret W. Mayall during the 1930s and 1940s, based on and expanding the earlier Draper catalog."" -quote from http://freerepublic.com/focus/chat/700581/posts\n\nSo it would seem the 18 isn't necessarily the 18th planetary nebulae, just the 18th faint object in their catalog.\n\nFor more info check out \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hourglass_Nebula (I updated the article to include the Mayall/Cannon info so hopefully others won't have to scour the net.)

449,2,"Simply put, reduction division is the FIRST division in MEIOSIS in which the number of chromosomes is reduced to half their original number, hence you go from 2N to N, or an example of humans would be 46 to 23 chromosomes, after which there is crossover and you end up with 4 varities in MALES and 2 in FEMALES, one of which will not produce progeny even if fertilized by mistake. Once fertilization between these gametes occurs you end up with 46 chromosomes once again, 23 from each gamete. The production of gametes is called GAMETOGENESIS, which i assume is what you are asking about. Hope that helps!"

These atomic particles are full of energy and as they travel (They can travel in a vacuum with no problem) they often encounter and collide with other matter.  Some of the energy of the particle is then transferred to the matter it collides with.  This energy causes the atoms to move around which causes heat energy to be released.\n\nIt works similarly to how a gun works in a vacuum.  The bullet does not require the air as a medium for it to travel to its destination.  When it arrives at its destination, it transfers its energy into what it collides with."

They are local infections.  See your doctor, not quacks.\n\nHomeopaths are dangerous for the following reasons.  Let's use herbal remedies.\n\n1.  Herbs have more than one chemical compound.  Herbs have tons of chemical compounds,  with few of them probably researched.  You might be taking in a beneficial compound, while taking in fifteen unhealthy compounds found in the same plant.\n\n2.  The active ingredient may not be healthy.  Echinecea was touted as beneficial for your immune system and would help you fight off the flu.  It is now known that it does not help fight off colds or flu and is actively harmful to your immune system.\n\n3.  Herbal remedies do not control the dosage.  You take a capsule of St. John's Wort (which has been shown to help fight depression)... but how do you dose it?  It could have 1 milligram of active chemical or 55 milligrams.  It all depends on where it was grown, the strain of the plant, how it was processed, etc.  When you buy over the counter medications, the dosage is carefully measured.\n\n4.  Your herbal remedy may not contain just your herb.  When herbal companies buy up herbs from farmers, they may not be getting just the herb they want.  Other plants may have been accidently or purposely introduced by the farmer.  If the farmer only produced 15 tons of St. Johns Wort, but needs to fill an order for 16 tons, he might mix in a ton of alfafa to meet the order.  Weeds might be accidently included.\n\n5.  Natural does not equal healthy.  Poison Ivy and poison oak are produced naturally.  Does that mean that they are good for you?\n\nForget the homeopathic treatment.  Use them as a last resort.

484,2,"Stomata are open when the guard cells that surround them are turgid, meaning they have absorbed water to increase their interior pressure.  When a sugar solution is placed around these guard cells artificially, it has the effect of changing the osmotic pressure, causing water to diffuse outward from the guard cells, lowering their interior pressure and causing the stomata to close.  This mimics the changes in sugar concentration in guard cells when the cells are exposed to sunlight and produce sugar by photosynthesis.  Higher sugar concentrations inside the guard cells draws water into the cells by osmosis, causing the cells to swell and thus causing the stomata to open.  All of this allows more diffusion of gases through the stomata into and from the interior of a plant leaf during the photosynthetic process."

489,2,"Domestication of plants is done in order to increase yield, improve disease resistance and drought tolerance, ease harvest and to improve the taste and nutritional value and many other characteristics. Centuries of careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant breeders use greenhouses and other techniques to get as many as three generations of plants per year so that they can make improvements all the more quickly.\n\nPlant selection and breeding in the 1920s and '30s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in New Zealand. Extensive radiation mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn and barley.[citation needed]\n\nFor example, average yields of corn (maize) in the USA have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001, primarily due to improvements in genetics. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. South American average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, Egypt and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8 t/ha. Higher yields are due to improvements in genetics, as well as use of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, growth control to avoid lodging).[citation needed] [Conversion note: 1 bushel of wheat = 60 pounds (lb) â 27.215 kg. 1 bushel of corn = 56 pounds â 25.401 kg]\n\nIn industrialized agriculture, crop ""improvement"" has often reduced nutritional and other qualities of food plants to serve the interests of producers. After mechanical tomato-harvesters were developed in the early 1960s, agricultural scientists bred tomatoes that were harder and less nutritious (Friedland and Barton 1975). In fact, a major longitudinal study of nutrient levels in numerous vegetables showed significant declines in the last 50 years; garden vegetables in the U.S. today contain on average 38 percent less vitamin B2 and 15 percent less vitamin C (Davis and Riordan 2004).\n\nVery recently, genetic engineering has begun to be employed in some parts of the world to speed up the selection and breeding process. The most widely used modification is a herbicide resistance gene that allows plants to tolerate exposure to glyphosate, which is used to control weeds in the crop. A less frequently used but more controversial modification causes the plant to produce a toxin to reduce damage from insects (c.f. Starlink).\n\nAgriculture may often cause environmental problems because it changes natural environments and produces harmful by-products. Some of the negative effects are:\n\n    * Nitrogen and phosphorus surplus in rivers and lakes.\n    * Detrimental effects of herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, and other biocides.\n    * Conversion of natural ecosystems of all types into arable land.\n    * Consolidation of diverse biomass into a few species.\n    * Soil erosion\n    * Depletion of minerals in the soil\n    * Particulate matter, including ammonia and ammonium off-gasing from animal waste contributing to air pollution\n    * Weeds - feral plants and animals\n    * Odor from agricultural waste\n    * Soil salination .\n\nOthers are currently including the current global climate change"

500,2,"There is no evidence to show conclusively that life ever existed on Mars, and the lack of evidence strongly suggests there never was life there.  If even bacteria lived there some trace would show up in the fossil record, and so far the probes have found no evidence of this.\n\nIt doesn't mean that there isn't life somewhere on the planet, or that life existed there once upon a time, but it's highly likely that there never all that much life on the planet.  Life tends to spread -- for example, no matter where we look on the Earth, we find some evidence of life, even if only bacteria, even in the frozen arctic or the middle of the sahara desert.\n\nAt the present time humans cannot live on Mars without an artificial environment.  The air pressure is far too low and the atmosphere has far too little oxygen.  The temperature extremes are far worse than even in the Antarctic.  \n\nWhile it is possible to build a ""Marsbase"" of some kind the difficulty lies in getting all that material over to Mars from Earth and then down from Mars orbit.  It's one thing to drop a probe through the atmosphere and bounce it hopefully somewhere within a 100-mile radius of its intended landing site; it's quite another to have a steady drop of material that all has to land in the same place.\n\nNaturally the builders could make use of local materials.  The main problem is the lack of water, which only seems to exist on the surface at the poles.  Therefore the base would probably have to be located at or near the polar areas of Mars, so that ice could be harvested and used to produce oxygen."

505,2,"The most obvious answer is that it reflects the sky since you can see reflections of clouds also. But reflection is only part of the answer. \n\nIt is true that part of the light you see is a surface reflection of sky light. The amount of this sort of reflection, though, depends on a number of things such as your viewing angle. On the other hand, much of the color you see comes from the water's depths. \n\nWhite sunlight contains all colors. Water absorbs some of these colors more than others. But you need a lot of water to notice this effect - which is why water cupped in your hand has no color at all. In a large body of water though, the water molecules quickly absorb red light, but they don't absorb blue light nearly as well. So in this case, more blue light is transmitted through the water. It's actually the same principle behind why the sky is blue. \n\nThe blue effect is often increased because ocean and lake water usually contains floating particles of dirt, and dead and living plants and animals. They help reflect the blue light back upward - so that the lake or ocean looks blue. The blue-green of tropical waters is due entirely to absorption of red light rather then suspension of particles. It's a different blue than the blue of the oceans off the northeast coast, whose blue is caused by suspended particles and plants. \n\nSo now we know why some bodies of water appear blue, but what about the other water colors, like gray, brown and black? Different colors can be produced by specific things suspended in the water. Mud acts in the opposite way from water -- it reflects red light more than blue. So muddy water looks brown. Since rivers are big transporters of mud, they usually appear brown. Peat dissolved in water absorbs almost all the light that touches it - so a lake full of peat may look black. The ocean often usually looks gray on a stormy day. Partly, that's reflected gray sky - but it's also because clouds filter out a lot of the sun's red light before it ever reaches the water. \n\nColors of water can be pretty distinctive. The Black Sea is so named because of its color, a very dark almost black color. In this case, it's the almost constant fog over the Black Sea that absorbs incoming light and makes the sea appear black. It was enough to make the Turks and many other sailors want to avoid what they saw as an evil looking sea!"

For the most part, you can count on a 5 or 6 hour flood stage from low to high tide, followed by a 5 or 6 hour ebb stage back to low tide.\n\nOther forces effect tides (such as the sun's gravity), but as far as time of day for high and low tides, nothing compares to the moon's gravitational tug."

517,2,"That depends. A lot of consumer electronics use a ""wall wart"" -- a transformer that converts AC to DC power. These usually have a coaxial plug in the device. Look at the transformer and see if it says something like 6VDC 200mA. It will also show which part of the plug is + and which is -. Now, if you want to run off a car battery, you can buy a car adapter that will fit these plugs. Or, you could buy a plug and a battery holder if you supply the right batteries. But the higher the mA rating (milliamps, 1/1000 of an amp) the less the batteries will last. So something running off 6V would require 4 D cells, for example and the right plug. Also if the adapter says AC you may not be able to use this method -- it would depend on the internal design of the device. Note that doing this has some risk of damaging your device though. Be careful and make sure you know what you are doing. If you don't know what you are doing, get someone  who is an electronics hobbyist (like a ham radio operator or an electronics student or teacher at a local school) to help you.\n\nAnother way is to use an AC inverter. This takes DC power (usually, but not always from a car battery) and converts it to plain old 110V. These have gotten much cheaper recently. If you aren't using a car battery, you can find units from Black and Decker and others that have gel cell batteries in them so you just carry around 110V AC. These go by names like ""storm station"" and you, of course, have to recharge the battery from time to time."

548,2,"The lymphatic system and the cardiovascular system are closely related structures that are joined by a capillary system. The is important to the body's defense mechanisms. It filters out organisms that cause disease, produces certain white blood cells and generates antibodies. It is also important for the distribution of fluids and nutrients in the body, because it drains excess fluids and protein so that tissues do not swell up. ""Lymph"" is a milky body fluid that contains a type of white blood cells, called ""lymphocytes,"" along with proteins and fats. Lymph seeps outside the blood vessels in spaces of body tissues and is stored in the ""lymphatic"" system to flow back into the bloodstream. Through the flow of blood in and out of arteries, and into the veins, and through the lymph nodes and into the lymph, the body is able to eliminate the products of cellular breakdown and bacterial invasion. Two very large areas are of significance in this system - the right lymphatic duct which drains lymph fluid from the upper right quarter of the body above the diaphragm and down the midline, and the thoracic duct, a structure roughly sixteen inches long located in the mediastinum of the pleural cavity which drains the rest of the body. It is through the actions of this system including the spleen, the thymus, lymph nodes and lymph ducts that our body is able to fight infection and to ward off invasion from foreign invaders. Lymph plays an important role in the immune system and in absorbing fats from the intestines. The lymphatic vessels are present wherever there are blood vessels and transport excess fluid to the end vessels without the assistance of any ""pumping"" action. There are more than 100 tiny, oval structures (called lymph nodes). These are mainly in the neck, groin and armpits, but are scattered all along the lymph vessels. They act as barriers to infection by filtering out and destroying toxins and germs. The largest body of lymphoid tissue in the human body is the spleen. \n\nThe immune system is composed of many interdependent cell types that collectively protect the body from bacterial, parasitic, fungal, viral infections and from the growth of tumor cells. Many of these cell types have specialized functions. The cells of the immune system can engulf bacteria, kill parasites or tumor cells, or kill viral-infected cells. Often, these cells depend on the T helper subset for activation signals in the form of secretions formally known as cytokines, lymphokines, or more specifically interleukins. The purpose of this article is to review the organs, cell types and interactions between cells of the immune system as a commentary on their importance and interdependence on the T helper subset. Such an understanding may help comprehend the root of immune deficiencies, and perceive potential avenues that the immune system can be modulated in the case of specific diseases.\n\n\n\n\nThe Organs of the Immune System\nBone Marrow -- All the cells of the immune system are initially derived from the bone marrow. They form through a process called hematopoiesis. During hematopoiesis, bone marrow-derived stem cells differentiate into either mature cells of the immune system or into precursors of cells that migrate out of the bone marrow to continue their maturation elsewhere. The bone marrow produces B cells, natural killer cells, granulocytes and immature thymocytes, in addition to red blood cells and platelets. \n\nThymus -- The function of the thymus is to produce mature T cells. Immature thymocytes, also known as prothymocytes, leave the bone marrow and migrate into the thymus. Through a remarkable maturation process sometimes referred to as thymic education, T cells that are beneficial to the immune system are spared, while those T cells that might evoke a detrimental autoimmune response are eliminated. The mature T cells are then released into the bloodstream. \n\nSpleen -- The spleen is an immun"

Electrical power is amperes times volts, or W = I * V\n\nIn this case, W = 60 and V = 120, so we rearrange it:\nW = I * V or \nI = W/V or \nI = (60 watts/120 volts) = 0.5 A\n\nAs for the atom model problem...hmmm! Si is the symbol for silicon. It has an atomic number of 14 (not 16) and an atomic mass of 28.085. According to the Bohr model of an atom, every atom has electrons (with no mass, and a negative charge), protons (with a mass, and a positive charge) and neutrons (with a mass, and no charge). The number of protons and electrons must be equal in order for the atom to have no charge, if one is greater than the other, it results in an ion (positive ion if protons are greater than electrons, negative ion if electrons are greater than protons). Electrons orbit around a nucleus of protons and neutrons.\n\nNow, an element's atomic number (14 in this case) is the same as the number of protons (and electrons, since the element is not an ion, in this case). So a silicon atom has 14 electrons orbiting around its nucleus, and its nucleus also has 14 protons and a number of neutrons.\n\nThe electrons orbit in shells around the nucleus. In the case of silicon, the inner shell has two electrons, the next shell has the maximum number possible or eight, and the third shell has the other electrons, or four. (To check, 2+8+4 = 14.) \n\nFinally, the number of neutrons in the nucleus can be calculated if we know how much a neutron weighs and how much a proton weighs. If N is the weight of a neutron, and P is the weight of a proton, and the number of neutrons is n1, and the number of protons is n2, and we say that the atomic weight is A, we have:\n\nA = (n1 * N) + (n2 * P)\n\nWe want to find n1, so we rearrange this like:\n(n1 * N) + (n2 * P) = A\n(n1 * N) = A - (n2 * P)\nn1 = (A - (n2 * P))/N\n\nNow all we have to do is plug in the relevant values, and we shall get the number of neutrons in an atom of silicon:\nA = 28.085\nn2 = 14\nP = \nN = \n\nSo, n1 = (A - (n2 * P))/N = \n\nSimple! Or at least, simpler! :)\n\nI know what you're going through...getting back into the swing of things after you've been away from school for a long time can be a pain.

First the rate of genetic mutation in DNA is known. \n\nSecond, there is no telling what evolutionary pressures will cause an expression of a gene to reflect a mutation ahead of the event.\n\nThird, given all of the mutagenic chemicals used in so many facets of production and general living, it is hard to make the prediction you ask for.\n\nConsider these: \n\nIn fewer than 70 years our ability to use penicillin and many of the early antibiotics is severely diminished.  in fact there are strains of bacteria that are completely resistant to some antibiotics (i.e: vancomycin resistant enterococus = VRE). As people improperly use antibiotics, new and hardier strains of bacteria emerge.\n\nThe thre most devistating epidemics in human history were variation of the inlfuenza.  The first is the Spanish Flu of 1918 which killed more people in 18 months than WWI, or (24 years of AIDS).  Here is what the WHO says about all three (Spanish Flu, Asian Flu, and Hong Kong Flu).\n\nPandemic influenza\n\nThree times in the last century, the influenza A viruses have undergone major genetic changes mainly in their H-component, resulting in global pandemics and large tolls in terms of both disease and deaths. The most infamous pandemic was âSpanish Fluâ which affected large parts of the world population and is thought to have killed at least 40 million people in 1918-1919. More recently, two other influenza A pandemics occurred in 1957 (âAsian influenzaâ) and 1968 (âHong Kong influenzaâ) and caused significant morbidity and mortality globally. In contrast to current influenza epidemics, these pandemics were associated with severe outcomes also among healthy younger persons, albeit not on such a dramatic scale as the âSpanish fluâ where the death rate was highest among healthy young adults.\n\nMost recently, limited outbreaks of a new influenza subtype A(H5N1) directly transmitted from birds to humans have occurred in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China in 1997 and 2003."

If energy or momentum leaves one system, it must enter another system. If energy appears in a system, it had to have come from one. Momentum is never really gained or lost, and same with energy -- it is simply transfered from one body to another. An elastic collision is one in which no kinetic energy is lost, all of it is transfered directly from one system to another.. In an inelastic collision, some of the energy is transfered to a third system (via sound waves, heat energy, or other such energy loss). In this case of an inelastic collision, the total kinetic energy of the two bodies before, is not the same as it is afterwards. The difference in these values would be the energy ""lost"" from these systems that was tranfered elsewhere."

Think of each small area below the cloud as one of the numbers on the dice. There is an equal probability at any given time that a raindrop occupies any of the areas. That is so because of the process involved in raindrop formation.\n\nRaindrops form when tiny cloud droplets which are basically suspended collide to form ones large enough to fall from the cloud. Though it is theoretically possible that the collisions occur such that the drops form a line, random chance of the collisions causes there to be a similar amount of space between them. Not an equal amount of space though - because that also would defy the laws of chance that some will be closer together and some will be further apart. Having exactly the same space between them would be like rolling 100 of each number each time you try the experiment."

In some instances infection did not progress further; in others it spread into the CNS with initial involvement of the trigeminal centers in the pons and medulla as early as the 4th day and by the 5th day was further advanced but still limited to the brainstem. Once infection was established it progressed both rostrally and caudally, at times with great rapidity, through the brainstem and reached the cord on the 6th or a later day.

It only applies to things moving close to the speed of light- I think it's the Schroedinger Equation that covers the inter-relation.

611,2,"There are several advantages to flying at night instead of during the day, some or all of these may have an influence on migration times.\n\nTaking their direction from the position and polarized light of the setting sun ensures that they start off facing the right way.\n\nDaytime predators such as falcons are avoided.\n\nDehydration that could result from flying for hours in warm, sunlit skies is reduced.\n\nThermals and updrafts are less common at night, without sunlight creating pockets of differential heating.  This makes night flying smoother, and more stable.\n\nFlying at night means that foraging activities take place on the ground during the day when most birds visual acuity is greater.  This means that food detection and selection as well as predator avoidance are scheduled at a time when their senses are best suited for the task.\n\nAt night the moon and stars are often visible, adding back-up navigational aids to the internal compasses and directional sense that the birds already have."

620,2,"Now-a-days, nuclear energy means utilizing the process of nuclear fission in order to boil water and turn a turbine in order to generate electricity.\n\nThe pros to this method of energy production are that (by comparison to other [fossil] fuels such a coal, oil, ...) there is much less polution. HOWEVER, the polution that is produced is a really nasty, terrible, deadly type of polutuion which will cause problems for humanity for hundreds of thousands of years to come, unlike coal which just produced a buch of CO2 and soot.\n\nThe cons are that, even though it is rare, there is a possibility for a melt down (or worse) if something should go wrong.  Although in the 50 some-odd years of nuclear energy so far, there have only been a few memorable ""disasters"" (Cheronoble, 3 mile island), but these disasters have the potential to cause massive problems for many years and hard many more people than another type of energy could.

652,2,"Helium is a colorless, odorless, tasteless chemical element. It is the most unreactive of the noble gases and therefore the least chemically-active chemical element on the periodic table. Its boiling and melting points are the lowest among the elements; except in extreme conditions, it exists only as a gas. At temperatures near absolute zero, it is a superfluid, a nearly frictionless phase of matter with unusual properties.\n\nAfter hydrogen, helium is the second lightest element and the second most abundant element in the universe, created during big bang nucleosynthesis and to a lesser extent from nuclear fusion of hydrogen in stars. On Earth, helium is primarily a product of the radioactive decay of much heavier elements, which emit helium nuclei called alpha particles; it is found in significant amounts only in natural gas, from which it is extracted at low temperatures by fractional distillation.\n\nFirst detected in 1868 by French astronomer Pierre Janssen as an unknown yellow spectral line signature in the light of a solar eclipse, helium was separately identified as a new element later that year by English astronomer Norman Lockyer. Its presence in natural gas in large, useable amounts was identified in 1905. Helium is used in cryogenics, as a deep-sea breathing gas, for inflating balloons and airships, and as a protective gas for many industrial purposes, such as arc welding. Inhaling a small amount of the gas temporarily changes the quality of a person's voice; however, caution must be exercised as helium is an asphyxiant.\n\nHelium is a colorless, odorless, and non-toxic gas. It is the least reactive member of group 18 (the noble gases) of the periodic table and therefore also the least reactive of all elements; it is inert and monatomic in virtually all conditions. It has a thermal conductivity that is greater than any gas except hydrogen and is specific heat is unusually high. Helium is also less water soluble than any other gas known and its diffusion rate through solids is three times that of air and around 65% that of hydrogen.[1] Helium's index of refraction is closer to unity than any other gas. Helium has a negative Joule-Thomson coefficient at normal ambient temperatures, meaning it heats up when allowed to freely expand. Only below its Joule-Thomson inversion temperature (of about 40 K at 1 atmosphere) does it cool upon free expansion. Once precooled below this temperature, helium can be liquefied through expansion cooling.\n\nHelium is chemically unreactive under all normal conditions due to its valence of zero. It is an electrical insulator unless ionized. As with the other noble gases, helium has metastable energy levels that allow it to remain ionized in an electrical discharge with a voltage below its ionization potential. Helium can form unstable compounds with tungsten, iodine, fluorine, sulfur and phosphorus when it is subjected to an electric glow discharge, through electron bombardment or is otherwise a plasma. HeNe, HgHe10, WHe2 and the molecular ions He2+, He2++, HeH+, and HeD+ have been created this way. This technique has also allowed the production of the neutral molecule He2, which has a large number of band systems, and HgHe, which is apparently only held together by polarization forces.[1] Theoretically, other compounds, like helium fluorohydride (HHeF), may also be possible.\n\nThroughout the universe, helium is found mostly in a plasma state whose properties are quite different to molecular helium. As a plasma, helium's electrons and protons are not bound together, resulting in very high electrical conductivity, even when the gas is only partially ionized. The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind together with ionized hydrogen, they interact with the Earth's magnetosphere giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora.\n\n\n[edit] Solid and liquid phases\nHelium solidifies only under great pressure.

653,2,"That is a good & interesting question.\n\nIn all logical aspects, this should occur due to the fact that everything in nature trys to balance out. This includes things like air pressure; it travels from high to low areas of pressure. In the same manner, everything that is uphill or of higher elevation trys to balance w/ those that are of lower elevation; hence erosion & drainage basins in general.\n\nIn order for this to occur, a lot of sediment would have to be washed into the drainage basin's streams & rivers. That would take a very long time.\n\nAlthough I think the answer here has to do with the fact that the earth's crust rebounds in a process called isostatic adjustment.\n\nWhen material is removed from the crust to another location, weight is taken off of an area.

I have friends who are great doctors, and majored in engineering, art, math and other non-medical things.  Get good grades.  You are better off getting good grades at an average school than mediocre grades at a tough school.  You'll get out of college what you put into it.  If you work part time, get grants or scholarships, and pick a school that doesn't cost too much, you don't have to have a huge debt load.\n\nMCAT:  Study like hell.  Learn what needs to be learned for the MCAT and kick butt on that test.\n\nMed School:  If you want to reduce your debt, consider the military (they'll pay your way through med school for 8 years of service) or other government programs - there are some that pay your debt if you work in underserved areas, or in public health jobs.  You'll have to research that, and you have at least 4 years to do so.\n\nAfter medical school, you are qualified to do nothing.  You have to do a residency.  You get paid as a resident, but not much.  The hours are long, but it's better now than it used to be.  Residency is a minimum of 3 years, and can go 7 or more, depending on what you want to do.  YOU HAVE TO START PAYING BACK YOUR LOANS AS A RESIDENT, even if you're not making much.  Keep that in mind as you accumulate debt.\n\nHope that helps."

Ore is crushed to typically 1"" to 2"" in size then sent to a kiln. Simply heating the ore in a kiln to 1,100 Deg. F, all of the mercury will vaporize into the kiln (mercury vaporizes at 675 deg F). The kiln vapors then must be condensed, by cooling, to recover the mercury, which becomes liquid at temperatures below 675 deg F and freezes solid at 2.8 Deg. F. Some free mercury in the ore can be recovered on Deister wet gravity concentration tables, also. \n\nTypical minerals found with cinnabar include silica, calcite, pyrite, marcasite and bitumen.

721,2,"Steel is a metal alloy whose major component is iron, with carbon content between 0.02% and 1.7% by weight. Carbon is the most cost effective alloying material for iron, but many other alloying elements are also used.[1] Carbon and other elements act as a hardening agent, preventing dislocations in the iron atom crystal lattice from sliding past one another. Varying the amount of alloying elements and their distribution in the steel controls qualities such as the hardness, elasticity, ductility, and tensile strength of the resulting steel. Steel with increased carbon content can be made harder and stronger than iron, but is also more brittle. The maximum solubility of carbon in iron is 1.7% by weight, occurring at 1130Â° Celsius; higher concentrations of carbon or lower temperatures will produce cementite which will reduce the material's strength. Alloys with higher carbon content than this are known as cast iron because of their lower melting point. Steel is also to be distinguished from wrought iron with little or no carbon, usually less than 0.035%. It is common today to talk about 'the iron and steel industry' as if it were a single thing; it is today, but historically they were separate products.\n\nSteel is often classified by its carbon content: a high-carbon steel is serviceable for dies and cutting tools because of its great hardness and brittleness.\n\nlow- or medium-carbon steel is used for sheeting and structural forms because of its amenability to welding and tooling. \n\nAlloy steels, now most widely used, contain one or more other elements to give them specific qualities. \nAluminum steel is smooth and has a high tensile strength. \n\nChromium steel finds wide use in automobile and airplane parts on account of its hardness, strength, and elasticity, as does the chromium-vanadium variety. \n\nNickel steel is the most widely used of the alloys; it is nonmagnetic and has the tensile properties of high-carbon steel without the brittleness. \n\nNickel-chromium steel possesses a shock resistant quality that makes it suitable for armor plate. \n\nWolfram (tungsten), molybdenum, and high-manganese steel are other alloys. \n\nStainless steel, which was developed in England, has a high tensile strength and resists abrasion and corrosion because of its high chromium content."

729,2,"Note that we're not taking energy differences into account.  In cases where the difference in orbital energy is greater than 15eV you get negligible overlap.  Now onto the symmetry-allowed overlaps.\n\n1s and 2s are both spherical and overlap to form a sigma bond.\n\n1s and 2p(x) form a sigma bond.  You can tell because if you draw the 2p(x) lobe you'll see it overlap with the corresponding 1s.\n\nThe 2p(x) and the 2p(y) do not overlap.  There is no possible bond.  Draw the 2p(x) extending toward the other atom as positive or shaded (remember: positive does not denote charge).  The other atom has its 2p(y) pointing up and down (perpendicular) and there is equal positive and negative overlap, thus canceling both of them out.  No net overlap.\n\n3p(y)-3p(y) form a pi bond.  Once again, draw these out and see it for yourself.  Draw the 3p(y) orbitals as rather fat so you can see how they overlap.  Since they are not cylindrically symmetric they are not a sigma bond.  Pretend you were to rotate one of the atoms about the x-axis... you would change orientation and there'd be less overlap.  For the sigma bonds above, rotation does not affect the overlap.\n\n2p(x)-2p(x) have positive overlap.  Draw them and see why.  They point toward one another.  Moreover, if you rotate one of the 2p(x) orbitals about the x-axis you keep the same structure/orientation since the 2p(x) is along the x-axis.  Thus, you can tell that this gives a sigma bond."

732,2,"In each half-cell is a chemical undergoing either oxidation or reduction. In a full electrochemical cell, one side must be losing electrons (oxidation) in to its electrode while the other half-cell gains electrons (reduction). If the atoms/ions involved in the reaction are metal, the same metal is used for each electrode. If the atoms/ions involved in the reaction at each half-cell are not metal, obviously no electrode can be constructed out of it. Nonreactive metals such as platinum are used as a substitute. Finally, a salt bridge is necessary to provide electrical contact between the cellsâbut without the solutions mixing. This can simply be a strip of filter paper soaked in saturated potassium nitrate (V) solution.\n\nDifferent choices of substances for each half-cell results in varying potential differences. Each reaction is undergoing an equilibrium reaction between different oxidation states of the ionsâwhen equilibrium is reached the cell cannot provide further voltage. In the half-cell which is undergoing oxidation, the closer the equilibrium lies to the ion/atom with the more positive oxidation state the more potential this reaction will provide. Similarly, in the reduction reaction, the further the equilibrium lies to the ion/atom with the more negative oxidation state the higher the potential."

751,2,"The human skeleton is made of individual or joined bones (such as the skull), supported and supplemented by a structure of ligaments, tendons, muscles, cartilage and other organs.\n\nThe skeleton is not unchanging; it changes composition over a lifespan. Early in gestation, a fetus has no hard skeleton; bones form gradually during nine months in the womb. At birth, all bones will have formed, but a newborn baby has more bones than an adult. On average, an adult human has 206 bones (according to Gray's Anatomy, but the number can vary slightly from individual to individual), but a baby is born with approximately 300 bones. The difference comes from a number of small bones that fuse together during growth, such as the sacrum and coccyx of the vertebral column. An infant is born with pockets of cartilage between particular bones to allow further growth. The sacrum (the bone at the base of the spine) consists of five bones which are separated at birth but fuse together into a solid structure in later years. Growing is usually completed between ages 13 and 18, at which point the bones have no pockets of cartilage left to allow more growth.\n\nNot all bones are interconnected directly. There are 6 bones, the auditory ossicles (three on each side), in the middle ear that articulate only with each other. Another bone, the hyoid bone in the neck, does not touch any other bones in the body, and is supported by muscles and ligaments; it serves as the point of attachment for the tongue.Also some of the ribs called the floating ribs only hang by muscle and are not attached to the spine.\n\nThe longest and heaviest bone in the body is the femur and the smallest is the stapes bone in the middle ear.

783,2,"Fuel Cell is a device in which the energy of a chemical reaction is converted directly into electricity. Unlike a battery, a fuel cell does not run down; it operates as long as fuel and an oxidant are supplied continuously from outside the cell. Several companies are developing fuel cells that they hope will replace conventional internal-combustion engines in automobiles over the next few decades.\n\nHydrogen Fuel Cells:\n\nIn a hydrogen fuel cell, hydrogen is supplied to the fuel cellâs anode, and an oxidant, commonly the oxygen present in air, is supplied to the cathode. The fuel cell strips electrons from the hydrogen atoms. These electrons move from the anode through the electric circuit to the cathode, creating an electric current that can be tapped to provide power. The electron-deficient hydrogen atoms meanwhile pass through the electrolyte to the cathode. There the electrons that passed through the circuit recombine with the electron-deficient hydrogen atoms. Oxygen (from the air) reacts with this reformed hydrogen, producing water. Water produced at the cathode has to be removed continuously to avoid flooding the cell.\n\nHydrogen fuel cells hold great promise as low-pollution automobile engines if certain difficulties can be overcome. Water, the only waste product of a hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell, is nonpolluting and can be used to cool the engine. The oxygen the cells need is readily available in air. Hydrogen, however, is not so readily available, and there is no existing delivery system to convey hydrogen to all the places people would need it to power their cars. In addition, pure hydrogen is not abundant enough to provide power for all the cars on the road today. Instead, hydrogen would need to be extracted from other substances, a process that requires energy. This energy could conceivably be provided by nonpolluting and sustainable energy resources, such as wind or solar power"
784,2,"you don't see anything, you feel warmth."
785,2,"Consider for a moment what happens when you place your 1 ft. rod between two metal plates affixed so as to be immovable. The rod doesn't expand, and depending on how much power you pump into it might cause either your rod or your motor to break. In order to the rod to successfully expand, it has to push the intervening material out of the way - which means that there must be more force coming from the rods on one side than is being applied by the rods on the other side. Now you are presumably aware that the forces from the rods are not transmitted instantly - rather the atoms from one rod push on the atoms next to them which push on the atoms next to them and so on. This means that the forces from the expanding rods travel as compression waves at the speed of sound in the material you are using. Let's let one unit of time equal the amount of time it takes sound to travel a distance of one rod. Then at T=1 every rod in the chain, except for the ones on the ends, is receiving equal force from every direction and does not get out of the way, and so the rods do not expand. The exception is the rods on the end, which receive force from only one side and get kicked off at up to twice the speed of sound in your rods (their own expansion rate plus the rate of expansion of the rod pushing them off - and the rods can't expand faster than this simply because if they did, the end of the rod wouldn't get out of the way of the middle of the rod fast enough and you'd get a shockwave that breaks your rod). At T=2, then, the second rods from the end fly off at the same speed - the moving rods at the end are still moving away and don't get in the way of them. At T=3, the third rods from the end fly off, and in general you get a wave of rods finally free of the rods next to them and thus able to expand and fly off traveling from the end of your chain to the middle at the speed of sound in your rods - which is slower than the speed of light.\n\nBy the way, about that ""twice the speed of sound"" - before you even ask, no, you can't get FTL by using a material where the speed of sound is greater than .5c, even if such a material existed, because the only reason the expansion force can reach the far end of the rod currently being launched is because it travels through a moving medium (the rod currently being accelerated). Thus it is more accurate to say that the speed of the far end of the rod is up to the speed of the rod pushing it away plus the speed at which it pushes itself off the far end of that rod. Even if both speeds exceed .5c, their sum will not, as the relativistic velocity addition formula ((u+v)/(1+uv/cÂ²)) dictates. Conceptually, you might thik of this as the rod being launched expanding slower because of time dilation and length contraction due to the velocity of the launch itself."
786,2,"I think that metal detectors just work by setting up a magnetic field. When the apparatus move over a location that has a magnetic material a flux is produced that induces an electric current in the metal detector, activating a sensor.\n\nIf this is the case (i'm 95% sure it is), then the only factors affecting it's quaility would be within the machine itself as far the smallest current that activates the sensor.\n\nHeat and moisture would not change the magnetic field (moisture might theoretically alter the detectors magnetic field a little bit, but certainly not enough to measure). The both give the same result."
787,2,The method we use to practice at home for making coconut oil is - first select mature coconuts fresh or dried. Then remove the outermost cover including the fibrous part. Split the coconut into halves and let it dry in bright sun. The process of drying continues until the moisture in the coconut flesh disappears and also the coconut gets separated from the shell by it self.Once the coconuts are completely dried they are chopped to small pieces and grinded to extract oil. The extracted oil is then collected after filtration. Also the remainings of the coconut  after extraction is used as a food for the cattle.

799,2,"Far from the deadliest epidemic.\n\nThe Bubonic Plague. \n\nJust mention the name and you will send shivers down the spine of many people. \n\nThere is no doubt that this disease was deadly. Deadly and gruesome to watch. \n\nThe death rate was 90% for those exposed to the bacterium. It was transmitted by the fleas from infected Old English black rats. The symptoms were clear: swollen lymph nodes (buboes, hence the name), high fever, and delirium. In the worst case, the lungs became infected and the pneumonic form was spread from person to person by coughing, sneezing, or simply talking. \n\nFrom the time of infection to death was less than one week. \n\nThere were three major epidemics - in the 6th, 14th, and 17th centuries. \n\nThe death toll was 137 million victims. \n\nAs a result, the plague is considered to be the worst epidemic of all time, but it wasn't (not that we are downplaying the severity of the plague). \n\nAt its worst, the bubonic plague killed 2 million victims a year. \n\nThis is certainly a bad situation, but there is one that is worse. \n\nThe pandemic (an epidemic that is spread worldwide) that killed at least 25 million people in one year. \n\nA disease that is largely forgotten. \n\nA disease that occurred in the 20th century! \n\nI know what you're thinking - AID's, Syphilis, or the dreaded Ebola. \n\nAll are wrong. \n\nIt was the influenza of 1918-1919, right after World War I (the war killed 9 million men in 4 years) \n\nThis was no minor disease - everyone on the planet was at risk. \n\nAnd it was started right here in the good old U. S. of A. \n\nIn one year, nearly twenty million cases were reported in the United States, accounting for almost one million deaths. \n\nThe cause is still unknown, but is believed to have been a mutated swine virus. \n\nIt all started on the morning of March 11, 1918 at Camp Funston, Kansas. \n\nA company cook named Albert Mitchell reported to the infirmary with typical flu-like symptoms - a low-grade fever, mild sore throat, slight headache, and muscle aches. Bed rest was recommended. \n\nBy noon, 107 soldiers were sick. \n\nWithin two days, 522 people were sick. Many were gravely ill with severe pneumonia. \n\nThen reports started coming in from other military bases around the country. \n\nThousands of sailors docked off the East Coast were sick. \n\nWithin a week, the influenza was hitting isolated places, such as the island of Alcatraz. \n\nWhatever the cause, it was clearly airborne. \n\nWithin seven days, every state in the Union had been infected. \n\nThen it spread across the Atlantic. \n\nBy April, French troops and civilians were infected. \n\nBy mid-April, the disease had spread to China and Japan. \n\nBy May, the virus was spread throughout Africa and South America. \n\nThe actual killer was the pneumonia that accompanied the infection. \n\nIn Philadelphia, 158 out of every 1000 people died. 148 out of 1000 in Baltimore. 109 out of 1000 in Washington, D. C.. \n\nThe good news (if there was any) was that the disease peaked within two to three weeks after showing up in a given city. It left as quickly as it arrived. \n\nThe United States death toll was a total of 850,000 people, making it an area of the world that was least devastated by this virus. \n\nSixty percent of the Eskimo population was wiped out in Nome, Alaska. \n\n80-90% of the Samoan population was infected, many of the survivors dying from starvation (they lacked the energy to feed themselves). \n\nLuxury ocean liners from Europe would arrive in New York with 7% less passengers than they embarked with. The confined area of the ship was especially conducive to the spread of the disease. \n\nIn the end, 25 million people had died. Some estimates put the number as high as 37 million. \n\nEighteen months after the disease appeared, the flu bug vanished and has never shown up again. \n\nSo what happened? \n\nUntil recently, no one was really sure.  In March of 1997, the news broke that res"

807,3,"Without actually seeing a picture of you, it would be impossible to answer that question. There are also other factors involved. Do you mean physically ugly or ugly in regards to your personality and attitude? \n\n1. If you are concerned with your physical looks, then you can take steps to improve the way that you look. Just remember, beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder. Maybe just changing the way you feel about yourself will help others to see you differently.\n\n2. If it is your personality that you think may be ugly, then just work on changing the way you act and treat other people. I was raised to treat people the way that I would want them to treat me. It has always been very good advice for me. \n\n\nSince you needed to ask this question, I would say that you definitely need to work on improving yourself in your own eyes. You can get help with your physical appearance through books, Internet, spas etc. Pamper yourself with baths, manicures, pedicures, hair-dos etc. Learn to apply make-up to enhance your coloring and facial features. You can find out when Department Stores in your area are doing free make-up sessions and go and have them show you the best colors for you and the best way to apply make to enhance your good features and minimize your features that you don't like. If you need to lose weight or tone up your body, you can get books, tapes or go on the Internet and find diet and exercise plans. Make sure you wear clothes that fit properly and are good colors for your skin tone and that enhance your looks. Take a friend that will be honest and get his/her advice about the clothes. The most important change that you need to make though is loving and respecting yourself and having good self esteem. Without those things, none of the other things will matter. When you exude confidence you attract attention and people will see you in the way that you see yourself. I don't mean that you should walk around acting conceited and full of yourself, because that will turn people off, just be yourself and like the person that you are inside and know that you're unique and that you are a wonderful and loving person and people will respond in a positive manner.\n\nIf it is your personality that needs work, that will have to come from inside yourself. Try to find out why you are ugly inside (if that is the problem) and then work on changing the way you react to the things that make you treat others badly. Again, if you work on loving and respecting yourself and raising your self esteem, then you won't feel the need to treat others badly in order to make yourself feel good. Good Luck! I am sure you are a very beautiful person!\n\nS.S."

Then just try to lift th hair above the skin level with the pin, BUT if you cant do it after four digs then stop, because the hair isnt long enough yet and you will only cause the skin to scar if you keep going. Just leave it, and try again in a couple of weeks when the hair should be long enough to remove easily this way."

OSHA limits noise exposure levels in the work environment to about 90dB for an 8-hour period, but permits exposure to higher levels for short periods. Many experts believe that the OSHA numbers are too high for hearing safety. EU countries have very strict laws about noise exposure. For example, U.K. employers must take action at two levels of noise exposure: 85dB and 90dB. At 85dB, employers must offer hearing protection and hearing education to employees. At 90dB or higher, employees MUST wear earplugs, and the employer MUST try to reduce the ambient noise level. \n\n90 dbA 8 hrs \n92 dbA 6 hrs \n95 dbA 4 hrs \n97 dbA 3 hrs \n100 dbA 2 hrs \n102 dbA 1.5 hrs \n105 dbA 1 hr \n110 dbA 0.5 hr \n115 dbA 0.25 hr or less \n\n\nNote: When the daily noise exposure is composed of two or\nmore periods of noise exposure of different levels, their combined effect should be considered, rather than the individual effect of each. Exposure to impulsive or impact noise should not exceed 140 dB peak sound pressure level."

It can NOT swing like that! Dangerous - can cause strokes, heart attacks, internal organ damages.\n\nThe question is - what did he eat that put him over the edge? Sweets? Alcohol? just even a big sandwich? does he have the flu? Alot of things can affect sugar.\n\nHe DOES need to call his doctor immediately and schedule an evaluation of diet and medication to see what the right combination is for him.\n\nMy step bro uses the insulin pump with great sucess -he's one that never took care of his sugar either -with it swinging up and down - now with the pump he is better managing his diabetes - althoug he still doesn't follow the correct diet that he should - and I'm not saying it is easy to do that. I have 10lbs to lose and I can't even do that right - its HARD!! But..its IMPORTANT and diabetics can live very healthy energetic lives and grow to old age if they work cooperatively with their doctor.\n\nYou also - MUST check on him -if his sugar is out of whack so that he's not passing out and no one finds him alone..My stepuncles wife (my stepaunt if you will) her brothers died within 2 months of each other. 34 and 37 years old - both had unregulated diabetes. Both were home ALONE and had bad reactions - and no one knew. it was horrifically sad.\n\nAgain I'm not saying this to upset you -but its a serious disease that needs to be monitored. Call your friend and have him get someone over there to sit with him.\n\nAnd lastly - please forgive me for saying this - but his diabetic problems can not be something you make yourself sick over -HE HAS TO DO IT FOR HIMSELF. And yes - as his friend you should encourage that he get the help he needs. We all suffered so much guilt when my stepfather died - but know what? I miss him, I love him, he was amazing - but he did it to himself...he started smoking after his kidney transplant again...he didn't exercise, he didn't watch his diet - and we lost him- its been 11 years and I still cry.\n\nForward this information to your friend and tell him he can do it!!

GNC is the only place that I've found that carries a chewable form, but you can also get the pill form at WalMart. I now treat every infection with only this product. I take up to eight chewables 2x's daily. It restores the balance within one day. These are not medications, but the natural bacteria that keep things in check in our bodies."

846,3,"He has shingles, which is herpes simplex and it is not caught from one person to another.  However, you do need to stay away from anyone who has not had chicken pox or the shot.  Shingles is caused from being stressed out and very upset to the point that a nerve comes to the surface and literally burns out which causes the red rash.  It is very painful and it circles the area where the nerve goes and then ends.  He can get it again if he is subject to being nervous or upset.  I have had shingles so many times I now have permanent symptoms in my face, which is numbness and tingling. The sexual herpes is a different type altogether and is caught from one to another and cannot be cured.  There are medications for shingles, but they do not do too much for the problem.  You just have to wait it out.  The symptoms usually last up to four weeks."

Butter is undesirable because it contains many fatty acids that are foreign to the human body.  research has shown that butter contains over 200 fatty acids, including trans fatty acids that arise in the rumen of the cow from bacterial action.  Most margarines are made from partially hydrogenated soybean oil.

886,3,"If you have any concerns I advise you talk to your Dr, because they will be able to apply all your husbands symptoms and answer your questions. I can only give speculative advice that is not to be taken as medical knowledge. Sickle Cell Anemia is a genetic disease (Born with it) of the Red Blood Cell where the molecule responsible for carrying Oxygen (Hemeoglobin) is made wrong. This causes the red blood cells to take a funny shape ""like a oval or sickle"". The person who has sickle cell anemia can suffer from many conditions resulting from the abnormal shapped Red Blood Cell. 1. Anemia - Which is low red blood cell count. Due to your body destroying the defective ""sickle"" shapped red blood cells. When your body destroys the red blood cells, you have a harder time delivering oxygen to your tissues and sometimes can be easily fatigued or tired a lot. 2. Patients with sickle cell anemia are also at an increased risk for blood clots because the blood vessels are good for transporting normal round red blood cells, but the sickle shapped ones tend to get stuck in some of them. Pneumonia is simply stated, fluid in the lungs because of some other cause. Usually it is because of a bacterial infection or sometimes a viral infection. There can be other causes too that can result in the lungs filling with fluid. The main focus is ensuring the person with the disease is getting enough oxygen to their tissues. If you husband has sickle cell anemia then he will already, depending on the severity have trouble oxygenating his tissues. Remember sickle cells are removed from the blood by your own body thereby reducing your ability to transport Oxygen. Your Dr. will know how to effectivly treat his condition, but understanding what is going on with your husband condition will hopefully help you to feel more comfortable."

889,3,"I used to suffer from these quite a bit as well.\n\nShin splints are associated with pain in the anterior tibia caused by overuse of the anterior tibilias muscle. They are most common in inexperienced runners or runners who overtrain. The pain is usually worsened by exertion and other factors:\n\n- Running on hard surfaces\n- Insufficient padding in the shoes \n- Over-pronated and/or flat feet can also lead to increased stress on the lower leg muscles during exercise\n- High arched feet can experience shin splint discomfort because this foot type is a poor shock absorber.\n\nThe treatment for shin splints is rest. Running and other strenuous lower limb activities should be avoided until the pain subsides and is no longer elicited by activity. In conjunction with rest, icing and anti-inflammatories may be suggested by a doctor or trainer, though there is some controversy over their effectiveness. A contributing cause of shin splints in some cases is the relative weakness of the muscles on the anterior of the lower leg compared to those in the calf. In this case exercises that preferentially strengthen the anterior muscles may help alleviate or avoid shin splints.\n\nIf you are just starting to run. Take it easy and progress into a walking program first before running. \n\nThe best advice I give you to start is change your running shoes and go to a specialized store (like the running room) which educate you on the most effective shoe for your foot and running style.\n\nA Rundown on Shin Splints\nhttp://preventdisease.com/news/articles/rundown_shin_splints.shtml"
890,3,"Health savings account is maintained by employers for any salary portion set aside (at the discretion of employees).  So employees would elect to set aside a certain amount of their pre-tax weekly salary to a 'health savings account' which is held in trust by the employers. \n\nWhen you incur healthcare expenses, you can then make a claim to the employer and have the money already set aside by employer taken out to 'reimburse' the said expenses.  \n\nThe advantage of having a HSA is that you get taxed less, because the amount set aside for HSA is taken out of your pre-tax income, so you end up with less taxable income, hence less tax bill.  \n\nDifferent employers have different HSA rules - some employers would only keep the amount set aside in trust for a calendar year, and any unused amount will be forfeited (will not be refunded back to the employees), however some employers would let the amount vest for an indefinite period of time until the retirement / resignation of employee."
891,3,"I will tell you from experience it is not as bad as people make it sound. I would say 3 maybe 4. It really all depends on how much pain you can tolerate, how well you take care of yourself, and if you follow through with what you need to do after. One thing I suggest is to really study up on the doctors in your area and ask people who have used the doctor you may use. My sister-in-law recieved one a couple of months before me and she was in total pain, that scared the crap out of me, I almost backed out. I went through with it and I love it. I was back at work within 3 days, (not with everyone). What I realized was she (my sister-in-law) doesn't take care of her body very well so her body didn't not take it so well. I wish you luck with your decision"
892,3,"Cystocele\n\nA cystocele (SIS-tuh-seal) is a medical condition that occurs when the wall between a woman's bladder and her vagina weakens and allows the bladder to droop into the vagina. This condition may cause discomfort and problems with emptying the bladder. A cystocele may result from muscle straining during childbirth, heavy lifting or repeated straining during bowel movements. Because the hormone estrogen helps keep the muscles around the vagina strong, cystocele is more common after menopause when levels of estrogen decrease.\n\nA bladder that has dropped from its normal position may cause two kinds of problemsâunwanted urine leakage and incomplete emptying of the bladder. In some women, a fallen bladder stretches the opening into the urethra, causing urine leakage when the woman coughs, sneezes, laughs, or moves in any way that puts pressure on the bladder.\n\nA cystocele is mild (grade 1) when the bladder droops only a short way into the vagina. With more severe (grade 2) cystocele, the bladder sinks far enough to reach the opening of the vagina. The most advanced (grade 3) cystocele occurs when the bladder bulges out through the opening of the vagina.\n\nA doctor may be able to diagnose a grade 2 or grade 3 cystocele from a description of symptoms and from physical examination of the vagina because the fallen part of the bladder will be visible. A 'voiding cystourethrogram' (sis-toe-yoo-REETH-roe-gram) is a test that involves taking x rays of the bladder during urination. This x-ray shows the shape of the bladder and lets the doctor see any problems that might block the normal flow of urine. Other tests may be needed to find or rule out problems in other parts of the urinary system.\n\nTreatment options range from no treatment for a mild cystocele to surgery for a serious cystocele. If a cystocele is not bothersome, the doctor may only recommend avoiding heavy lifting or straining that could cause the cystocele to worsen. If symptoms are moderately bothersome, the doctor may recommend a pessary, a device placed in the vagina to hold the bladder in place. Pessaries come in a variety of shapes and sizes to allow the doctor to find the most comfortable fit for the patient. Pessaries must be removed regularly to avoid infection or ulcers.\n\nLarge cystoceles may require surgery to move the bladder back into a more normal position and keep it there. This operation may be performed by a gynecologist, a urologist, or a urogynecologist. The patient should be prepared to stay in the hospital for several days and take 4 to 6 weeks to recover fully."
893,3,"its a bone scan A seratec scan uses the same tracer, technetium, as a traditional technetium bone scan, but instead of attaching it to calcium-like material to follow bone activity, the tracer is attached to white blood cells, the cells that help you fight off infection.  When injected back into the body, the labeled white blood cells migrate towards any infection that may be present.  If they accumulate in some location, this test may help  determine where an infection may be present.   This test is an excellent imaging test to assess for osteomyelitis (bone infection)."

903,3,"Growing up I used to get ulcers (cankers) maybe once or twice a month and I usually just put up with them. I tried tons of different medicines and nothing really worked consistently.\n\nHOWEVER, in college, my roomate had ulcers tons worse than I did and he used an ointment called ""Orabase"" and that soothed the pain for a while. It numbs the spot for a couple hours and works really well if you put it on before you eat. \n\nTHEN I moved to China about 7 months ago and the food here is usually extremely spicy or very sweet....so my ulcers went from twice a month to twice a week. I talked to an American doctor living here and he told me to try a herbal vitamin called ""L-lysine""...and my gosh...after taking one of those pills once a day for a while...I haven't had a serious one in about 5 months. That was the miracle stuff. I took one every day for a few weeks, now I only take them when I start to feel one develop and it goes away quick...if it even gets started.\n\nYou could go to a pharmacist or a herbal vitamin store and ask for it. I'm usually really skeptical of herbal stuff, but this stuff really worked!\nGive it a try. For me, it was really that simple. It may be different for different people, but out of all the mess and mouthwashes I've used over the years, nothing cleaned them up like this.

917,3,"It depends on the levels. Very high is very bad for you. Chlorine is used to kill most germs in the pools. In Europe there are 2 pools, 1 which you swim in and the other to treat the water where the chloramines (cancer causing) are kept to a very very small level. In North America they use a different system which is much cheaper but uses higher levels of Ozone in their surge tank which gives a higher risk of cancer. Chlorine can cause also breathing problems and irritate your eyes. Also is can turn bleached hair green. On the plus side it can whiten your teeth. Flourine is similar to chlorine and is still in the tap water in North America due to the fact it gives you whiter, healthier teeth. But in Britain this was stopped some time ago due to the fact that it can cause health problems (still wonder why the Brits have bad teeth?). North America goes wholescale on all the water treatment processes from drinking water to swimming pools which is why costs are cheaper but health issues are sometimes skipped over. But the risk of swimming in un-chlorinated water is far greater! It is basically a stagnant lake otherwise. So chlorine can cause cancer on a small level but in North America it can be improved upon by implementing the decontaminating routine used in Germany where most chloramines are removed before people go swimming."

Chiropractors define themselves by what they choose NOT to prescribe (prescription drugs and incisive surgery).

So, yes, Chiropractors can prescribe exercise regimens.\n\nI am a retired Chiropractor.  Best wishes."

Symptoms can vary from person to person, but there are common ones that generally occur:\n\nBleeding. This can range from brownish spotting to heavy bleeding. It is important to note that many women experience spotting or bleeding during pregnancy and about 50% of the time, the pregnancy progresses normally. \nPain or cramping in the lower abdominal area. The pain could be on just one side, both sides, or in the middle. You may also experience pain in the genitals, lower back, thighs, or buttocks. \nYou may notice that pregnancy symptoms like nausea and breast tenderness have subsided or lessoned. Be aware that some women do not notice any change in these symptoms, while others do. \nSome women say that didn't ""feel right"" just prior to their symptoms. \nIf you are pregnant and experiencing symptoms you should contact your health care provider. If any of the following symptoms occur you should go the Emergency Room immediately:\n\nHeavy bleeding \nPassing clots or something that looks like tissue (bring the tissue to the hospital in a clean container) \nA fever higher than 100.4 degrees F \nDizziness or fainting \nA history of tubal (or ectopic) pregnancy \nSevere vomiting  \nSevere pain the abdomen or back \nIf you have any uncertainty about the need to contact your health care provider, call him or her immediately. \n\nHemmorging is bleeding out...alot of blood"

YOu have to keep it up.  So say you get it as a kid, say 4, then again at 14.  (it only last 10 years.)  Maybe you remember at 24 as you're starting your adult life.  But if you forget, and you're 34 and in the midst of rearing children and get it, guess what?  You get a horribly severe case, as adults get it way worse than kids.  And sometimes when adults get CP who have been vaccinated, they ALSO get shingles to go along with it!  Lovely, huh?!\n\nI'm all for vaccines, in general.

It is a very tough time in life and once you are done with this stage you will feel stronger and wiser, trust me. Now here is for the real life stuff, having a full time job is not all its cracked up to be , but if you feel you are ready for it than do it to the fullest. In regards to your GED , if your parents will not give you a ride find a friend, an uncle , an neighbor who will ,as long as they are safe , legal , and trustworthy; that way your parents will realize that you are willing to take something in your life seriously. Do this sit down and write realistically where you see yourself in 5 years , then work backwards to see how you can get yourself there. Life is a constant struggle, im dealing with struggles of my own , but all I can say is if you overcome this , the next battle will not feel as hard. You seem like you have an idea of what you want but you want some guidance, reach out to someone you trust to be your mentor. You will be fine.

999,3,"There are many treatments that you could pursue, such as freezing the warts, having them lasered off, creams such as the one Nurse Annie mentioned, etc.  But to prevent future outbreaks, try arming yourself with a DAILY vitamin regiment (not just when you have an outbreak). Taking a good multivitamin (like Men's One-A-Day or Centrum), vitamin C (about 2,000 to 4,000 mg DAILY **), vitamin E, astragalus, garlic (comes in odorless pill form),echinacea, vitamin B complex (at least 50 mg of each form of B-vitamin 3x daily), and zinc tablets(sold as lozenges and liquid form) will help boost your immune system and keep breakouts from occuring frequently. All these are sold at health food stores,such as GNC, or drugstores. Also healthy living i.e. leafy greens, high fiber and protein, soluble fats, no trans fat, lots of water, low sugar and salt intake, exercising regularly, good amounts of rest...all of these things play an important role in your overall health and wellness and will ultimately help you to boost your immune system, which will help you fight infections and breakouts of warts.\n\n**The vitamin C should be taken throughout the course of the day, not at one time. You can take anywhere from 2,000 to 4,000 mg but you should only take as much as your body will allow. Start at 2,000 mg and gradually increase until you notice changes in your bowel movements (runny, diarrhea). Also get the vitamin C with ester. Ester helps your body absorb more of the vitamin, as vitamin C is water soluble and will be expelled in large quantity in your urine."

1006,3,"I have been checking out ways to relieve soreness my muscles and so has my wife. At one point, we went to an old massuse that used chiropractic techniques as well as many herbal and vitamins. He was somehow able to find that my wife had an ulcer by rubbing her feet (relexology) and then went and pressed on a spot on her stomach that was indeed sore. He said that is an ulcer and if you press right there (how he was & she felt it) that over time it would help her. He did give her a ""tinture""? (spelling) kinda was a tea looking and tasting mixture of certain vitamins that he said she was short on (after taking a saliva sample and testing it).\n\nWe have also been looking at massage chairs and found a thermal (heated) massage bed called Ceragem that has infared heat. The bed is great to lay on and also there are attachments that you can put where ever you want and one that you can sit on. The ceragem bed is kinda spendy to buy (I think about $2500) but there is store near us that allows 1 free visit per day with a 40 minute ""demo"" version. They encourage you to come as many times as you want (once per day). They say that the heat and infared can help with stomach and digestive problems including ulcers. To find a dealer near you to try one out, click on the link and then the map. I honestly prefer the massage of other types of massage chairs better but I do like the strong heat that Ceragem has. I also included a link to see what a foot reflexology chart looks like incase you were curious... I don't know how to recommend a good massuse in your area as honestly there are some that are just ok and some that are just bad ones... good luck. Oh and I know my wife has said that yogurt helps her stomach ""settle"" some when her ulcers have been bothering her."
1007,3,"From Prescription for Nutritional Healing by Balch & Balch \n\nThe nails protect the nerve-rich fingertips and tips of the toes from injury. Nails are a substructure of the epidermis (the outer layer of the skin) and are composed mainly of keratin, a type of protein. the nail bed is the skin on tip of which the nails grow. Nails grow from .05 to 1.2 millimeters (approximately 1/500 to 1/20 inch) a week. If a nail is lost, it takes about seven months to grow out fully. \n\nHealthy nail beds are pink, indicating a rich blood supply. changes or abnormalities in the nails are often the result of nutritional deficiencies or other underlying conditions. The nails can reveal a great deal about the body's internal health. nail abnormalities on either the fingers or the toes can indication underlying disorder. \n\nThe following are some of the changes that nutritional deficiencies can produce in the nails: \n\nA lack of protein, folic acid, and vitamin C causes hang nails. White bands across the nails are also an indication of protein deficiency. \n\nA lack of vitamin A and calcium causes dryness and brittleness. \n\nA deficiency of the B vitamins causes fragility, with horizontal and vertical ridges. \n\nInsufficient intake of vitamin B12 leads to excessive dryness, very rounded and curved nail ends, and darkened nails. \n\nIron deficiency may result in 'spoon' nails (nails that develop a concave shape) and/or vertical ridges. \n\nZinc deficiency may cause the development of white spots on the nails. \n\nA lack of sufficient 'friendly' bacteria (lactobacilli) in the body can result in the growth of fungus under and around nails. \n\nA lack of sufficient hydrochloric acid (HCI) contributes to splitting nails. \n\nDISORDERS THAT SHOW UP IN THE NAILS \n\nNail changes may signify a number of disorders elsewhere in the body. These changes may indicate illness before any othersymptoms do. Seek medical attention if any of the following symptoms are suspected. \n\nBLACK, SPLINTER LIKE BITS UNDER THE NAILS can be a sign of infectious endocarditis, a serious heart infection; other heart disease; or a bleeding disorder. \n\nBLACK BANDS from the cuticle outward to the end of the nail can be an early sign of melanoma. \n\nBRITTLE, SOFT, SHINY NAILS WITHOUT A MOON may indicate an overactive thyroid. \n\nBRITTLE NAILS signify possible iron deficiency, thyroid problems, impaired kidney function, and circulation problems. \n\nCRUMBLY, WHITE NAILS near the cuticle are sometimes an indication of AIDS. \n\nDAR NAILS AND/OR THIN, FLAT, SPOON-SHAPED NAILS are a sign of vitamin B12 deficiency or anemia. Nails can also turn gray or dark if the hands are placed in chemicals such as cleaning supplies (most often bleach) or a substance to which one is allergic. \n\nDEEP BLUE NAIL BEDS show a pulmonary obstructive disorder such as asthma or emphysema. \n\nDOWNWARD-CURVED nail ends may denote heart, liver, or respiratory problems. \n\nFLAT NAILS can denote Raynaud's disease. \n\nGREENISH NAILS, if not a result of a localized fungal infection, may indicate an internal bacterial infection. \n\nA HALF-WHITE NAIL WITH DARK SPOTS AT THE TIP points to possible kidney disease. \n\nAN ISOLATED DARK-BLUE BAND IN THE NAIL BED, especially in light-skinned people, can be a sign of skin cancer. \n\nLINDSAY'S NAILS (sometimes known as 'half-and-half' nails), nails in which half of the top of the nail is white and the other half is pink, may be a sign of chronic kidney disease. \n\nNAIL BEADING (the development of bumps on the surface of the nail) is a sign of rheumatoid arthritis. \n\nNAILS RAISED AT THE BASE WITH SMALL WHITE ENDS, show a respiratory disorder such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis. This type of nails may also simply be inherited. \n\nNAILS SEPARATED FROM THE NAIL BED may signify a thyroid disorder (this condition is known as onyholysis) or a local infection. \n\nNAILS THAT BROADEN TOWARD THE TIP AND CURVE DOWNWARD are a sin"

You should contact a number of dentists in her area and see what they say. \n\nFor example, I knew someone once who had his in-laws visiting from Europe.

It turned out that the in-laws didn't have any insurance, and everyone panicked.\n\nThey were able to find a dentist-denturist team who were able to do the work at a fraction of the cost.

1010,3,"These sorts of behaviours are common amongst people with autism. It might be a behaviour that she engages in when the stimuli around her becomes too much and overwhelms her, similar to the common autistic 'flapping' (of the arms) behaviour.\n\nIs she living in a residential home? If so maybe check that she is getting the appropriate care she needs and if the environment it suited to her. What are the noise levels like? Does she get on with the staff? Is she eating well/sleeping well etc? (these can indicate how she is feeling)\n\nAlthough she has autism, you have still known her for a significant amount of time, and I trust that you will be able to gage her general mood to some extent.\n\nIt is worth speaking to the Psychologist (I am sure there will be one if your sis is living in a group home)  and she should be able to generate some strategies to phase out this behaviour which much be distressing for you to know your sister is engaging in.\n\nThere is also the possibility that maybe it is a physical problem affecting your sister. Because people with autism have difficulty communicating (you did not mention whether your sister uses speech at all), their behaviour changes for example, if somebody with autism has a toothache they might become aggressive and lash out at others or harm themselves.

1015,3,"The word ""bipolar"" is simply a label used to categorise a list of psychosocial traits that Psychiatry considers to be improper or abnormal in society. Psychiatry defines these traits as a ""mental illness"", and promotes it as a ""disease"" that requires ""treatment"".\n\nIt is not a ""disease"", despite claims or implications made by certain psychiatric and pharmaceutical organisations. There is NO credible scientific evidence that shows the existence of what constitutes ""bipolar"" as a biological/neurological disorder, brain abnormality or ""chemical imbalance"".\n\n""For a disease to exist there must be a tangible, objective physical abnormality that can be determined by a test such as, but not limited to, blood or urine test, X-Ray, brain scan or biopsy. All reputable doctors would agree: No physical abnormality, no disease. In psychiatry, no test or brain scan exists to prove that a 'mental disorder' is a physical disease. Disingenuous comparisons between physical and mental illness and medicine are simply part of psychiatry's orchestrated but fraudulent public relations and marketing campaign."" Fred Baughman, MD., Neurologist & Pediatric Neurologist.\n\n""Chemical imbalanceâ¦itâs a shorthand term really, itâs probably drug industry derivedâ¦ We donât have tests because to do it, youâd probably have to take a chunk of brain out of someone - not a good idea."" Dr. Mark Graff, Chair of the Committee of Public Affairs for the American Psychiatric Association. July, 2005.\n\nSymptoms that psychiatry labels as ""bipolar"" (or it's related disorders), can stem from any number of variable sources. Many people, for example, have overcome ""bipolar"" through megavitamin therapy and effective nutrition. A growing wealth of evidence supports that underlying nutritional deficiencies can cause even the most severe mental disorders, including symptoms labelled as ""schizophrenia"" [See source refs]\n\nBottom line? Psychiatry is a belief-system, a ""faith"", not a science. Despite the huge marketing strategies, the so-called ""research"" and all the propaganda thrown at the world, there is not one iota of scientific evidence that proves that ""schizophrenia"" or ANY mental illness, in fact, exists as an actual --medical disease--.\n\nIf you have been told differently then know this: You have been lied to.\n\nFor more information, please visit:\n\nhttp://groups.msn.com/psychbusters\nDecoding Psychiatric Propaganda\n\nFor information on non-drug / alternative approaches:\n- http://www.alternativementalhealth.com/articles/default.htm#B\n- http://www.pendulum.org/articles/articles_misc_lisaalt.html\n- http://www.truehope.com/_empowerplus/empowerplus.asp\n- http://www.mentalhealthproject.com/content.asp?id_Content=1575"

Also ognion + garlic.\n* Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits (whenever possible, of course)\n* If you really want a book, then check this out: The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook (Win95/98 only). Read more about this e-book here.\n\n\nâ¢ Eat fish, chicken, beef, pork. (preferences are in this order)\n\n* If you are a vegetarian, then ignore this!\n* Avoid fat meat\n\n\nâ¢ Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day. Don't EVER exclude bread from your diet!\n\nâ¢ Snacks between meals (if needed): apples, oranges, grepfruits and other NC fruits\n\n* Don't cheat ... NO cookies, chips, candies, brownies etc! \n* EVEN if they have ""low fat"" indication... They might have low fat, yet they can have lots of CALORIES !!!\n\n\nâ¢ About rice, potatoes, beans, [xxx]nuts, pastry, pasta... you know!\n\n* Don't eat too much of those, at least during the first weeks of the diet. I'm not a low carb addict, but I've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities, especially when associated with other foods.\n* If you like them a lot, try and eat them like one meal. A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch (never dinner!), followed by a nice big apple. These rich starch foods are not good for dinner!\n* At dinner time, chose mainly large mixed veggies salads... with fish, lean meat or cheese (if you are not a vegetarian). \n\nif u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it. no salt no nothing just plain. u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound. i heard that from a weight loss tape. the best drink is water or gatorade. thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo. if u want a macine. run with dumbells on a treadmill. u could do the rocky workout. but thats a new story. u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs\n\n1) It is not just the amount you eat, but what you eat. Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start. And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.\n\n2) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day. Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored. The other half of the time use weights, or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle ""burn"". A gym is also an option, but I don't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.\n\n3) Sleep well. To bed earlier and up earlier. Exercise in the morning when you wake up, not in the evening before bed. 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.\n\n4) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time. A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.\n\nThat is a good place to start... if you see good results, keep it up and modify to fit you... if it does not, see a doctor AND a trainer \n\nKeep working out, drink water a lot, eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities, vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice, fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours, minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important, your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hours\nthe most important thing is you don't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you want\n\nyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.com\n\ngood luck"

I was a DOS for 7 years and have seen alot of difference in physician training and abilities to maneuver the scope.  It also depends if the patient is cooperative on the length of time.

1063,3,"If a person's immune system becomes unable to prevent the bacteria from growing, the TB becomes active. Of people who have latent TB, 5% (1 person in 20) will develop active TB within 2 years after the initial infection. Another 5% of people who have latent TB will develop active TB at some point in their life.\n\nIt doesn't look like dormant TB develop into active TB easily. I understand night sweats is a symptom of TB, but one thing should not make you think you are in trouble. You still test positive on PPD even if your TB is dormant. But do see a doctor for your peace of mind.\n\nPeople who have latent TB may be at risk for developing the active disease if they:\n\nHave a condition or disease that weakens their immune system, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, some cancers, or poorly controlled diabetes. \nHave poor access to health care, such as homeless people, migrant farm workers, or people who abuse alcohol or drugs. \nTake medications that contain corticosteroids for a long time. \nHave a condition that results in an impaired immune system, which can occur in older adults, newborns, women who have recently given birth, or people who have had an organ transplant and are taking medications to prevent organ rejection. \nHave a chronic lung disease caused by inhaling sand-like dust (silicosis). \nAre 10% or more under their healthy body weight."

A hola hoop also works really well as does belly dancing.  Anything that makes you consentrate on hip movements will help.

If an optical system with astigmatism is used to form an image of a cross, the vertical and horizontal lines will be in sharp focus at two different distances.\n\nThere are two distinct forms of astigmatism. The first is a third-order aberration, which occurs for objects (or parts of objects) away from the optical axis. This form of aberration occurs even when the optical system is perfectly symmetrical. This is often referred to as a ""monochromatic aberration"", because it occurs even for light of a single wavelength. This terminology may be misleading, however, as the amount of aberration can vary strongly with wavelength in an optical system.\n\nfull story\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astigmatism"

I really want to know the answer to this question, and I never thought to ask it myself.\n\nObviously the brain (and possibly the body as well) requires some kind of regenerative process, just like it requires a certain amount of food and water and oxygen.  You can't go too long without either, or else your body will break down.  If you ""lose sleep,"" you suffer - no one gets away with it.  In fact, one of the ways they use to torture prisoners of war nowadays is sleep deprivation.  Even the most hardened killers begin to crack under its effects, physically and psychologically.  \n\nDo trees sleep?  You have to wonder.\n\nI'll let you in on one secret I know that most people do not.  One of the answers to your question is that the unconscious mind has about 1 million times more processing power than the conscious mind.  It would make sense if our body's natural functions require the full force of regulatory calculations that only the unconscious mind can perform.  In other words, if we only used our conscious minds to run our body and brains, we would quickly degenerate and die.  We're nowhere near as smart when awake as we are while asleep.  Unfortunately, the only way to do work (to get food & water) is to be awake, alert, receiving new data, and guiding one's movements.  Then again, we can live for decades in a coma.\n\nThis is such a great question."

1076,3,"Many patients travel from United States of America and UK to get low cost of Stereotactic Radiotherapy in India. One of the most frequently asked questions when considering Stereotactic Radiotherapy is ""how much?"" and âwhat is the price of surgery in India?â\n\nOftentimes, patients choose their surgeon on the basis of price. \nThe cost of Stereotactic Radiotherapy is very affordable in India and costs are much lower when compared to the United States, UK and other countries. However, since the success of your surgery is largely dependent on your choice of surgeon, cost should not be your main consideration for your decision to undergo Stereotactic Radiotherapy in India.\n\nI checked out the website of Forerunners Healthcare âwhich is the premier most medical tourism company in India offering low cost surgery in India to International Patients. They have served more than 400 International patients from across the globe (specially US and UK) to get low cost affordable surgery in India at the best Hospitals and Medical Institutions. And the general price of the Stereotactic Radiotherapy is as follows-\n\nThe Cost of Stereotactic Radiotherapy in India is $ 2,200.\n\nhttp://www.forerunnershealthcare.com\n\nIn India, any licensed medical doctor can perform Stereotactic Radiotherapy. To avoid unsatisfactory results, it is best to choose a surgeon who has completed an accredited residency-training program in Stereotactic Radiotherapy. He should have extensive experience in the procedure you will undergo. Thatâs when Forerunners Healthcare come into picture-helping you get the best surgeon for your surgery at the most affordable prices in the best Hospitals of India.\n\nYour surgeon's skill can make all the difference between a good and an average result. Thus, although it is understandable that price is one of the considerations in your choice of surgeon, it is important to remember that the main consideration should be your surgeon's professional qualifications and experience.\n\nBesides that you should look into other issues related to traveling abroad, which is your visa, passport, climate, cultural issues and language barrier. Although language is not a problem in India âas most of the people are well verse in English. But you should make sure that you have a reliable hand holding person to guide you through the various steps of getting medical treatment and surgery in India.\n\n\nHope this helps."

1079,3,"Be your own trainer and nutritionist, the basic rules to losing weight are no soda, no fast food, lots of chicken, fish, fresh (not canned thatâs bad) fruits and vegies, whole wheat stuff, yogurt. Not so many cakes and donuts and cookies. Basic common sense for eating, you just need to enforce it. Get all the bad stuff out of the house right away, just toss it or give it away while your still motivated. No alcohol and no smoking  if that applies. Lots of water, 3-4 liters a day, not all at once, but spread it out. Its really easy to down a liter or two while your watching tv or on the computer. Also drink some after you eat the bigger meals of the day, it helps your body pick out the nutrients in food when your food is more spread apart.  Donât think that sports drinks can replace water, the only time you need to drink them right after a workout, besides that just stick with water. These rules may be hard to adapt to at first so start with cutting out the things you know you can live without.  Then work from there.  Remember these are  perfect eating habits, it can take you a while to work into it.  If you know you canât live without your one treat a day, donât fight it by trying to eat something else, just eat it and make sure thatâs the only one you cheat on a day.  Otherwise youâll get depressed and quit.  Another important point is getting the right amount of sleep every night.  You need 8-9 hours of sleep each night for your body to function correctly.  This is an important factor of losing weight.  Set up a routine for yourself and go to bed at about the same time each night.  \nAs for exercise, lots of cardio. Find something you like. If you have never exercised much before, start with walking 30 minutes a day at a brisk pace. Move on to different terrains that include hills and increase the time spent. After a week or two, try jogging the route. No matter what find an activity you enjoy. Walking to jogging is just an example, try hiking, rollerblading, biking. Once you get into a regular routine, if your not happy with the level of difficulty, try signing up with a gym. Spinning, pilates or kickboxing classes are great. It will also introduce you to working with weights. Talk to a trainer for instruction before using any weights. A cheap investment is a balance ball, it works you stomach while your just sitting on it, like at your computer and its great for posture. There are hundreds of exercises you can use it for for your entire body. I can give you some ideas if you want, just email me.

There may be problems with such transplants -- they may require immuno-suppressive drugs like heart of lung or ... transplants do. But several of the transplant schemes think they've figured a way to avoid this, so... \n\nBe the best person you can be, learn as much as you can, and whatever boy you eventually find (or who finds you) will find all that (ie, you) much more interesting than the fundamentally trivial, though a real nuisance, diabetes. \n\nDon't despair, if you weren't worried about something you'd hardly be normal.

1096,3,"The water draining from an air conditioner is generally just plain old water.  The water comes from moisture in the air that condenses when it hits the cold coils in the air conditioner.  The moisture condenses on the coils and collects in the drain pan.  The water itself should not be dangerous.  However, if the water has been leaking for an extended period of time, you may want to check the area for mold (or have it professionally tested).  Some people are very sensitive to mold spores and can suffer allergic reactions.\n\nIf this was a recent, one-time leak, you should not have any issues with mold.  Just make sure that any wet sheetrock or carpet is thoroughly dried.  You can use a dehumidifier and/or box fans for this.  Also, cleaning the wall or hard floors with a dilute solution of bleach will help prevent any mold formation.  \n\nMake sure you have that area well ventilated (open windows) while cleaning with bleach.  I would not use bleach on the carpet for obvious reasons, but a steam cleaner may be a good idea.  Just make sure to dry everything thoroughly when cleaning is complete.\n\nThe drain line was probably clogged by a buildup of slime that is common in A/C drain lines.  Th line can be cleared by flushing the line with a hose to blow out any clogs.  Then pour some bleach through the line to clear up any slime buildup.  Make sure the line is still connected to the drain (not broken) when you flush or treat with bleach.  Otherwise, you may end up with more water on the floor."

Pharmaceutical companies make billions of dollars from psychiatric drugs and GPs seem to hand them out to people like candy. And what do these drugs actually do? They certainly do not cure anyone of anything. Mental illnesses are not physical diseases. Taking prozac for ""depression"" is not like taking insulin for diabetes. Psychiatry is total junkscience. All these drugs do is simply change the normal chemistry of the brain to create a false psychological state. Long-term use, like any other drug, can be seriously harmful, both physically and mentally, and yet many people swear by them as some sort of modern day wonder. These same people, i'm guessing, at the same time, are probably telling their kids about the dangers of smoking weed or snorting coke...! It's totally crazy.\n\nAll psychoactive drugs are harmful, whether ""legal"" or ""illegal"".

Only last July did the president of the APA, Dr. Steven Sharfstein admit that ""We do not have a clean-cut lab test"". Check the DSM IV and it even says it in there.

I know you're probably thinking that it hurts while it's inside of you for the amount of time it is, but you don't even know it's there. They'll most likely pull it out before you even wake up. They did mine. Good luck to you!"
1130,3,"I would try a few things before going to the eye doctor IF you are in pretty good health. It might be something just out of habit or common sense thats causing your body to wake up this way. \n\n1st thing I would try for 3-4 days straight is to jump in a hot shower as soon as you wake up. Make sure you hit your face and eyes and hair with a good cleaning. I suspect various body oils from your hair and/ or skin are getting into your eyes through out the night.\n\n2nd thought: Your body is low on nutrition and/or water first thing in the morning. With dehydration and the lack of vitamins, your eyes are suffering. Some people this matters, other people dont ever need vitamins. Depends how strong your gene set is and what other not so great habits you intake like smoking or drinking. So my suggestion is when you wake up and during sleep, have some vitamin water next to your bed and drink up. Then as soon as you wake up go make yourself a healthy vitamin liquid shake and see how your eyes react. \n\n3rd: Sounds silly but do some form of stretching and mild exercise like walk up some stairs slowlllyyyy 4-6 times. See if your eyes are coming better into focus then. I suspect maybe some kind of position in which you sleep is cutting off the oxygen and/or bloodflow to your eye area. Some people sleep face down on their hands in the face, this would be an example. \n\n4th: Sleep apnea is another suspect---try BREATH RIGHTS strips for 7-10 nights on your nose. See if you wake up more refreshed and your eyes arent as blurry. You might have a breathing problem the way you sleep. 1 out of every 7 adults sleep in some harmful way that is NOT healthy for the breathing --doesnt matter if you are overweight or unhealthy.  \n\nShould be very interesting to see what combinations of this or that above helps you out. Email me and let me know how it goes ok? Good luck."

If you are having an endodontist (a specialist that only does root canals) do the work, it should go more quickly than having a general dentist do it.  With most root canals, the tooth is sore for about 24-48 hours after the endo is done, this is due to them working on the tooth & it is completely normal. Root canals are about 90% successful; they may need future work on them & it is SO IMPORTANT to have a crown put on the tooth just as soon as you can!!!  Teeth that have had root canals become dry & brittle, so if you bit down on something just right you could break the tooth in a way that it may have to taken out; and that would be a waste of $$.

1138,3,"I would imagine that when you went to the doc, he or his nurse did the common checks (blood pressure, temp, etc)..

Beyond that, I would be concerned if your doc did not do all the things I have mentioned - you may want to consider changing primary physicians (also, you really should have the type of relationship with your doc that you could ask him what you have asked us - just a thought)....

There are medicines to cure diabetes but you will not believe.  It happened with many patients of mine and they continued to suffer without taking proper medicines and not listening to my advice.\n\nIn the meantime, please try some home remedies and I am sure you will come back to me after few days for more advice.  I am available on ""adam2madam@yahoo.com"" and trust is must to mail me.\n\nHome Remedies:\n\n1.  Drink the juice of one bitter gourd, one cucumber and one tomato on empty stomach in the morning on a regular basis.  This will bring your sugar level down and you will feel fresh.\n\n2.  Eat lots of cucumber to get rid of your dry mouth and frequent urination, if any.  Drink lots of water.\n\n3.  Please avoid Banana, Mangoes and Apple Custard completely.  These fruits contain lots of glucose and it is very dangerous for diatebes.\n\n3.  Brisk walking is always helpful for diabetic patients.\n\n4.  Avoid sugar and ice cream.  You may add sugar free tablets to your tea or coffee.\n\n5.  Take 500 ml sugarcan vinegar bottle and put 50 raw garlic flakes into the bottle and leave it for 10 days. Eleventh day onward, take one garlic flake from the bottle with one spoon vinegar after breakfast and see the result.\n\n6.  You must eat lots of other fruits like guava, watermelon, muskmelon, apple, pineapple, papaya and dry fruits to keep your stemina up.\n\n7.  To enhance your immune system, take 300g of Indian Gooseberry powder (preferable known as Amla) and 100g of dried ginger powder.  Mix them well and store in a glass jar.  Take one spoon powder daily by mixing in a glass of water.\n\n8.  Allopathic medicine can be taken if needed.  They only supress the disease and do not cure any ailment.\nAt lost, please do not allow my efforts to go waste and let me know the progress.\n\nBest of health,"

In that case, the point is to lower the temperature of a person or animals's (deceased) body to such a point that all cellular activity ceases.  In this sense, yes - cryonics works.  We can lower the temperature of a body to such a point that, we think, it can be preserved forever.  Why would we want that?  Some people think that by preserving their bodies, they can be thawed at some future point when *other, still-undiscovered* science can bring them back to life.

1241,4,"The above person has given you good advice.  I'll just add a bit to it by giving you a rough timetable, and some pointers.\n\nFirst, you will have to apply to colleges.  Most college applications will be due in December or January.  Make sure you apply to more than one college (perhaps five or so), since most students do not get into every school to which they apply.  Do your research before you select these colleges.  Visit websites like collegeconfidential.com, princetonreview.com, and look at annual rankings of colleges in  publications like ""US News and World Report.""  Look for information that is important to you, like location, available majors, cost, and the percentage of graduates who are successful in getting into medical school.  Also, make an appointment with your high school's guidance counselor, who should be a great help to you as you choose schools, and put your applications together.\n\nYou will also want to apply for federal financial aid using the FAFSA form.  It is due in January or February as well.  Your guidance counselor should be able to help with this as well.  \n\nMost colleges will inform applicants of their admissions decisions in April.  You will then have a few weeks to decide where you'd most like to go.  Compare their financial aid offers, and weigh their pros and cons before you make your final decision.\n\nSince you are not really familiar with what college is about, and you probably don't know what classes you should take, you should definitely begin college in August or  September, whenever the college you choose begins its regular school year.  That way, you can attend the formal orientation (these usually begin a week before classes start in the fall) where you can meet with an advisor who will help you choose your courses, meet other students, and familiarize yourself with the environment.\n\nMost good colleges and universities will have advising offices, where you can go for advice about how best to make yourself a good candidate for medical school.  \n\nThis is just general advice, but I hope you find it helpful.  I was the first in my family to attend college too, and it was a confusing process.  Things ended up great for me, and I'm sure things will turn out well for you, too."

Davis  \n \n  \n   Category:    Confederate Statesman  \n  \n  Born:    1826    \n  \n  Died:    1906    \n \n\nOverview:    First Lady of the Confederate States of America  \n  \nBiography:    Varina Howell Davis was born at her family plantation, the Briers, near Natchez, Mississippi in 1826. As a plantation ownerâs daughter, Davis received her education from a private tutor and later attended finishing school. She was seventeen when she met Jefferson Davis while visiting the Hurricane, the plantation of his older brother, Joseph Emory Davis. âUncle Joeâ was an old family friend, but it was the first time she met any of his extended family. Davis was taken with her beauty and intelligence, and by the time her visit ended two months later she and Davis were unofficially engaged. Margaret Howell, her mother, objected to the engagement. She was not convinced that Davis, widowed and eighteen years older than her daughter, was a good match for Varina. She thought he was too brooding, and feared that Varina would be second fiddle to his former wife. Eventually, however, she gave in and they were married on February 26, 1845.\n\n\n\nJefferson Davis had intended to live the life of a planter, but within just a few months of the wedding, he was nominated for a seat in the US House of Representatives. Long interested in politics, Varina was ideally suited for the life of a politicianâs wife. Varina had grown up believing strongly in the Whig party. She gave up her Whig beliefs, however, for the Democratic views of her husband. As her husband rose in political ranks, she rose in the ranks of Washington society. When Jefferson Davis resigned his seat in the Senate at the outbreak of the Civil War, Varina was depressed and sad to the leave the city that had become her home, having lived there for most of her adult life. \n\n\n\n\nThey returned to their Mississippi plantation, the Brierfield but their days there were short. Jefferson Davis was elected the President of the Confederate State of America and the Davises moved first to Montgomery, Alabama, the temporary capital, and then to Richmond, Virginia, the permanent capital. There she was pleased to find many of her Southern friends from Washington DC, including Mary Chesnut. Varina settled comfortably into her new role as First Lady, and enjoyed much public support and adulation for the first year of the Confederacy. During the second year, however, as living conditions deteriorated and commodities became scarce, people began to speak out and criticize. While acknowledging her intelligence, critics claimed she put on airs, and that she wasnât as well-read as she claimed. They accused her of being uncouth and domineering, having far too much influence over the President. Some accused her of entertaining too lavishly in such trying times, while others thought she was too skimpy and accused her of hoarding the Presidentâs salary. Others frowned upon her style of entertaining, thinking it too much in the manner of the Yankee capital of Washington DC, and questioned her loyalty to the Confederacy. Despite the criticism, Varina continued in her support of the troops. She knitted countless articles of clothing for soldiers, donated rugs for blankets and made shoes of the scraps. She spent hours visiting soldiers in the hospitals, although she did not serve as a volunteer nurse at the request of her husband.\n\n\n\n\nFollowing Jefferson Davisâs arrest at the end of the Civil War, Varina Davis and the children were sent to Savannah, where she complained of being a virtual prisoner as she was forbidden to leave the city. While she rarely ventured out, the children did. The soldiers, carpetbaggers and Union supporters treated the children cruelly and Varina constantly worried for their safely. After a former slave leveled a gun at one of them, she arranged for them to go to Canada along with her mother. Varina then turned her attention to gaining her husbandâs release f"

1253,4,"Construction\nConstruction started May 1914 and in 1916 it was opened to the public. At the time it was the world's largest pier, 292 ft wide and 3000ft long (89m x 914m).\n\nThe pier was designed as a shipping and entertainment area. In its first decade, the Municipal Pier was successfully attracting both visitors and ships. It was also temporarily used as a military facility during the first world war.\n\n\nDecline\nBy the end of the 1920s, the Navy Pier's success started to decline. The introduction of cars and the opening of movie theaters created more competition for the Pier. Shipping started to decline in the 1930s due to the depression and the competition of transportation by trucks.\n\n\nNavy Pier\nIn 1927 the pier was renamed Navy Pier in honor of World War I veterans. It would turn out to be a prophetic name change, as the Navy Pier served as a naval training facility during the second World War. After the war it served as the Chicago branch of the University of Illinois. In 1965 the university moved to its new location and the Navy Pier started to decay.\n\n\nRedevelopment\nThe first step in the redevelopment of the Navy Pier was the 1976 restoration by Jerome R. Butler, Jr. of the Auditorium building at the eastern end of the pier. One year later it was designated a Chicago Landmark. Another step to the redevelopment of the Navy Pier was taken in 1989, when the city of Chicago and the State of Illinois installed the Metropolitan Pier & Exposition authority. At the same time they committed 150 million dollar for reconstruction of the pier as a recreational center. The renovation by Benjamin Thompson & associates started in 1992 and was completed in 1994. The result is a very successful recreational center next to Chicago's downtown area. With many attractions and 50 acres of parks and gardens It attracts more than 8 million visitors each year. \n\n\nHeadhouse & Auditorium\nThe two major buildings on the Navy Pier, Headhouse and Auditorium - both designed by the architect Charles Summer Frost and constructed in 1916 - have survived its ups and downs.\n\nThe most western building, a brick and terra cotta building with two prominent towers is the Navy Pier Headhouse. The name was derived from the area, which at the time was known as the Headlands. Each tower housed a huge 2-million liter tank for the fire sprinkler system. The Headhouse is now home to Chicago's children museum. At the western side of the building is the recent 19acre Gateway Park, featuring a modern, computerized granite fountain with 240 jets.\n\nAt the other end of the pier is the Auditorium, also known as the Hall. This beautiful building with a magnificent Grand Ballroom measures 138 ft by 150 ft (42m x 48m) and has a 100ft (30m) high half-domed ceiling.\n\n\nAttractions\nThe Navy Pier is home to many attractions, some may vary depending on the season. For a comprehensive list, prices and schedules have a look at Navy Pier's own website: www.navypier.com. Here's an overview of attractions found at the pier:\n\n- The most eye-catching is the 148 ft Ferris Wheel. It was modeled after the first ferris wheel built for the 1893 World Columbian Exposition.\n\n- Near the Ferris Wheel is a 44ft high musical carousel with 36 hand-painted animals.\n\n- The skyline stage, a 100ft high vaulted roof structure, is used as an ice skating rink during wintertime and as a 1500-seat theater during summer.\n\n- The Navy Pier features two museums: the Children's museum (www.chichildrensmuseum.org) and the Smith museum of Stained Glass Windows, which opened in 2000.\n\n- A 7 story Shakespeare theater complex with a 525 seat theater is another recent addition to the Navy Pier.\n\n- Other attractions are an 18 hole miniature golf course, a funhouse maze, a 40ft high wave swinger and an IMAX theater.\n\n- The Navy Pier is also a starting point for many boat trips. You have ample choice: You can take a trip on a 148ft high, four-masted schooner "

1255,4,"As we come to the vertebrates, we begin to find real efficiencies with the closed system. Fish possess one of the simplest types of true heart. A fish's heart is a two-chambered organ composed of one atrium and one ventricle. The heart has muscular walls and a valve between its chambers. Blood is pumped from the heart to the gills, where it receives oxygen and gets rid of carbon dioxide. Blood then moves on to the organs of the body, where nutrients, gases, and wastes are exchanged. However, there is no division of the circulation between the respiratory organs and the rest of the body. That is, the blood travels in a circuit which takes blood from heart to gills to organs and back to the heart to start its circuitous journey again.\n\nFrogs have a three-chambered heart, consisting of two atria and a single ventricle. Blood leaving the ventricle passes into a forked aorta, where the blood has an equal opportunity to travel through a circuit of vessels leading to the lungs or a circuit leading to the other organs. Blood returning to the heart from the lungs passes into one atrium, while blood returning from the rest of the body passes into the other. Both atria empty into the single ventricle. While this makes sure that some blood always passes to the lungs and then back to the heart, the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood in the single ventricle means the organs are not getting blood saturated with oxygen. Still, for a cold-blooded creature like the frog, the system works well. Humans and all other mammals, as well as birds, have a four-chambered heart with two atria and two ventricles. Deoxygenated and oxygenated blood are not mixed. The four chambers ensure efficient and rapid movement of highly oxygenated blood to the organs of the body. This has helped in thermal regulation and in rapid, sustained muscle movements."

1332,4,"Prejudice is, as the name implies, the process of ""pre-judging"" something. It implies coming to a judgment on a subject before learning where the preponderance of evidence actually lies, or forming a judgment without direct experience. Holding a politically unpopular view is not in itself prejudice, and politically popular views are not necessarily free of prejudice. When applied to social groups, prejudice generally refers to existing biases toward the members of such groups, often based on social stereotypes; and at its most extreme, results in groups being denied benefits and rights unjustly or, conversely, unfairly showing unwarranted favor towards others.\n\nThis is different than viewpoints accumulated though direct life experience, which are neither prejudiced, conditioned or necessarily instinctive: they are not pre-judgments but post-judgments. Some argue that all politically-based views stem from a lack of sufficient life experience; this, however, provokes the question of how much life experience is required before a point of view is no longer regarded as prejudiced. If no amount of experience entitles a person to a viewpoint - if every is biased - then there can be no objectivity. Judgements based on experience may, however, be coloured by prejudice. One might imagine a continuum from ""prejudiced"" to ""based on experience,"" with many, if not most, views coming somewhere between the two extremes.\n\nFallacious extension of one's own negative past experiences to the general case can be harmful; it can be termed bias, or more colloquially, ""lumping"". If a person has developed the concept that members of one group have certain characteristics because of a sour past acquaintance with a member of that group, s/he may presume that all members of the group have such characteristics. For example, a person who has had a series of bad relationships with members of the opposite sex may develop a prejudice against that sex, thus adopting the prejudice known as sexism. This is typical of all prejudice: racism, linguicism, ageism, religious intolerance, heterosexism, prejudice based on differing political stances, etc.\n\nIn other cases, it may be a matter of early education: people taught that certain attitudes are the ""correct"" ones may form opinions without weighing the evidence on both sides of a given question. Many prejudicial behaviors are picked up at a young age by children emulating their elders' ways of thinking and speaking, with no malice intended on the child's part. The prejudiced adult might even be shocked to hear a slew of racial slurs and their own half-cocked opinions on various groups echoed back at them from their children. Early learning is highly influential, however, prejudice can be learned at any age.\n\nIn Jane Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice, the heroine forms a strong opinion of a man's character before she hears his side of the story. The balance of the facts, when finally made known to her, challenges and ultimately overturns this prejudice. Prejudice is also a theme in To Kill a Mockingbird, in which a man is wrongly tried and convicted because of his race.\n\nSociologists have termed prejudice an adaptive behavior. Biased views are necessary at times for human survival: we don't always have time to form a legitimate view about a potential foe before adopting a defensive stance that could save our lives. Conversely, prejudice is non-adaptive when it interferes with survival or well-being (e.g., refusing to patronize the only doctor in a town who could save you because he or she is black, or rejecting a potential friend/partner because of ethnicity).\n\nDiffering opinions of what constitutes prejudice can prompt us to reconsider our views, with an emphasis on self-understanding. Does, for example, criticizing another person as being prejudiced in itself sometimes involve pre-judging the very person being criticized? Another"

1356,4,"Two factors at least determine the spin rate of the Earth. The orbital distance from the Sun where the solid material condensed to form the Earth's body had a fundamental orbital velocity around the sun. As these materials coalesced into the Earth, they had to maintain the energy of their momentum during accretion. This resulted in the basic rotational speed of the solid Earth. Second, the Moon has an effect on the Earth. Since the Earth is about 80 times heavier than the moon, most of this effect is upon the Moon, which now turns at a rotational speed which places the heaviest side always facing the earth. On Earth the moon provides a slight attraction which is most easily seen in tides. This gravitational force is slowing the rotation of the Earth slightly. A possible 3rd factor is if the moon is the result of an impact of a large object on the Earth which caused ejected material to coalesce into the Moon. Such a large impact would effect the rotational speed of the Earth. Or the Moon may be a sister condensation that formed at the same time as the Earth and spun off into its current orbit.

1366,4,"The Renaissance has no set starting point or place. It happened gradually at different places at different times and there are no defined dates or places for when the Middle Ages ended. The starting place of the Renaissance is almost universally ascribed to Central Italy, especially the city of Florence. One early Renaissance figure is the poet Dante Alighieri (1265â1321), the first writer to embody the spirit of the Renaissance.\n\nPetrarch (1304â1374) is another early Renaissance figure. As part of the humanist movement he concluded that the height of human accomplishment had been reached in the Roman Empire and the ages since have been a period of social rot which he labeled the Dark Ages. Petrarch saw history as social, art and literary advancement, and not as a series of set religious events. Rebirth meant the rediscovery of ancient Roman and Greek Latin heritage through ancient manuscripts and the humanist method of learning. These new ideas from the past (called the ""new learning"" at the time) triggered the coming advancements in art, science and other areas.\n\nAnother possible starting point is the fall of Constantinople to the Turks in 1453. It was a turning point in warfare as cannon and gunpowder became a central element. In addition, Byzantine-Greek scholars fled west to Rome bringing renewed energy and interest in the Greek and Roman heritage, and it perhaps represented the end of the old religious order in Europe"

This earthquake proved that even Australia is not immune from damaging earthquakes causing significant human and economic loss.\n\nMost of the damage occured to unreinforced masonry buildings which had been built between 1900 and 1950. Over 3000 residences were damaged throughout the city. Until recently Newcastle was a steel manufacturing city, (BHP Steel closed late 1999) but at the time of the earthquake the steel mills were not severly damaged and gas and electricity sub stations did not incur major damage.\n\nGenerally speaking, most modern structures were generally not damaged; the exception was the Newcastle Workers Club, where a section built in 1972 collapsed, killing 10 people. The club was built in two main parts; an older unreinforced masonry section and a newer concrete frame section four stories high with underground parking. The collapse of the Newcastle Workers Club began at the top of the club causing the building to cascade into itself trapping patrons and workers within the building."

It's a small oval shaped rubber pad you stick on the top of the mouthpiece where you sit your teeth to stop you from biting too hard and scratching out a dent.\nSecondly, make sure you're breathing properly with your diaphragm. You need to sit up straight and breathe with your stomach so that you can feel the wind going all the way to the bottom of your lungs. The best way to experience this is to breathe out for as long as you can (without passing out!) then quickly take a big deep breath. This is how you should try to breathe when you play so you don't run out of breath but still get the same power in your sound.\nThirdly, if you have a teacher they've probably already told you, but sometimes you can get keys sticking down when you're not pressing them. You can fix this easliy by rubbing a piece of cigarette paper (Tally-Ho's are good) between the pad and the opening and pressing down on the key.\nThere's stacks more stuff you'll learn on the way & the best way to do that is to get a good teacher & listen to some professionals.\n\nGood luck & have fun! ;)"

I was bought up in a mixed race, mixed ability school with a deaf unit attached and I feel I am a better person because of it. My parents also bought me up to value people and not their labels. Sadly dyslexia has over time gained the label of stupid just as Downs Syndrome has gained the label disease and people who have Downs are thought of are worthless as they will never achieve anything. \n\nHowever I work with a child who has Downs and he is the most amazing kid ever he's cute, intelligent and very capable of making his own decisions. Later on he will go and live semi independently which is more then most people think he and other like him can do.\n\nThe thing that bugs me most is whenever I take him out in his buggy (he is 6 yrs old) people see him and give me sympathetic looks. I want to say now he has never given me much trouble and it is his brother who gives me the most trouble trying to get his on way.\n\nAlthough there will always be people out there who look down on dyslexics remember there are always people who look at them as equals, myself being one of them. People with learning difficulties are no different to any other person and just like other people if they are willing to work hard nothing will stop them.\n\nEven when people are told about a person being dyslexic there can still be problems.

1389,4,"Stress is simply a fact of nature -- forces from the outside worldaffecting the individual. Hence, all living creatures are in a constant interchange with their surroundings (the ecosystem), both physically and behaviorally. This interplay of forces, or energy, is of course present in the relationships between all matter in the universe, whether they are living(animate) or not living (inanimate). However, there are critical differences inhow different living creatures relate to their environment. These differences have far reaching consequences for survival. Because of the over abundance ofstress in our modern lives, we usually think of stress as a negative experience.But from a biological point of view, stress can be neutral, negative, orpositive. \n\nStress has driven evolutionary change (the development and natural selectionof species over time). Thus, the species that adapted best to the causes ofstress (stressors) have survived and evolved into the plant and animal kingdoms we now observe. Man, because of the evolution of the human brain, especially thepart called the neo-cortex, is the most adaptive creature on the planet. This adaptability is largely due to the changes and stressors that we have faced and mastered. Therefore, we, unlike other animals, can live in any climate orecosystem, at various altitudes, and avoid the danger of predators. Moreover, most recently, we have learned to live in the air, under the sea, and even inspace, where no living creatures that we know of have ever survived. So then,what is so wrong with stress?\n\nA brief history of stress\nA key to the understanding of the negative aspects of stress is the conceptof milieu interiur (the internal environment of the body), which was first advanced by the great French physiologist, Claude Bernard. In this concept, he described the principles of dynamic equilibrium. In dynamic equilibrium, constancy, a steady state (situation) in the internal bodily environment, is essential to survival. Therefore, external changes in the environment or external forces that change the internal balance must be reacted to and compensated for if the organism was to survive. Examples of such external forces include temperature, oxygen concentration in the air, the expenditure of energy, and the presence of predators. In addition, diseases were also stressors that threatened the constancy of the milieu interiur."

1405,4,"From 146 to 181.\n\nAssuming you're talking about US coins, there's a big problem: In November 1982, the US penny became about 0.6 gram lighter. The older coin was 95% copper and 5% zinc, while the new one is essentially copper-plated zinc (97.6% zinc and only 2.4% copper). The nominal mass of a penny before 1982 was 48 grains (about 3.11 g). The size of a penny changed very little (-0.84%) in 1982 but, because zinc is lighter than copper, the new coin's nominal mass is 2.5 g. \n\nThe price of copper had risen to $1.33 per pound in 1980, so pennies could not be minted for less than their monetary value.  Copper-plated coins postponed the crisis  (in 2000, it cost 0.81Â¢ to mint a penny). \nBefore 1982, there was about 146 pennies in a pound...  If all the pre-1982 pennies were out of circulation, there would be about 181 pennies to the pound. \n\nRight now, a pound of pennies from the street will contain anywhere between 146 and 181 pennies, depending on the percentage of pre-1982 pennies in it.  According to the US Mint, the approximate life span of a coin is about 25 years.  If we take this number at face value, there remains in circulation today (November 2000; 18 years later) approximately exp(-18/25), or about 48.7% of the pennies that were in circulation in November 1982. \n\nAssuming that the total number of pennies in circulation is the same today as it was in 1982 (which is probably not quite true), this would mean that a penny's mass in grams averages about 3.11(0.487)+2.5(1-0.487) which is very close to 2.8 g, so that there would be just about 162 pennies in a pound as of November 2000.  If there's already more than 160 pennies in a pound, the average penny is already slightly less than 1/10 of an avoirdupois ounce! \n\nThe above theoretical approach tells how the number of pennies in a pound varies with time, if we assume that the total number of pennies in circulation is held roughly constant...  However, it's all based on the ""approximate life span"" of 25 years quoted by the US Mint, which could be an overestimate for pennies.  If we are to believe some fundraisers, an average pound of pennies was already worth $1.64 (164 pennies to the pound) as early as September 1995, only 13 years after the introduction of the new penny.  164 pennies in a pound (of 453.59237 g) corresponds to a proportion (x) of pre-1982 pennies which is such that:  164  =  453.59237 / (3.11034768 x + 2.5 (1-x))   This would mean that x was already as low as 43.55% after only 13 years or so, implying that the average number of years (T) that a penny lives is such that exp(-13/T) = 0.4355.  T would thus be about 15.64 years, about  2/3  of what the US Mint states for its other coins."

The first 2.492 would consist of 78.12% (which is 100 units (my estimate) divided by the total of 128 (which you would have based on my estimate and 14 units in the spring and the fall), this semester would be 10.9% at 3.0 and 10.9% at 3.0 for Spring. Then multiply like this:\n\n(78.125% * 2.492) + (10.9375% * 3.0) + (10.9375% * 3.0) = 2.60\n\nIf you already have 80 units - it would look like this:\n\n(74.074% * 2.492) + (12.963% * 3.0) + (12.963% * 3.0) = 2.623\n\nand if it turns out that you get a 3.2 this quarter and Spring quarter:\n\n(74.074% * 2.492) + (12.963% * 3.2) + (12.963% * 3.2) = 2.67\n\nHope this helps. I will check later to see if you added more information.\n\nOKAY - with the additional information - here is where you are:\n\nCurrently 88 units at 2.492 - if you get a 3.0 with 14 units this qtr. and 3.2 with 16 units in Spring you will have a 3.648. If Spring is a 3.0 you will have a 2.62. \n\nIf you got a 3.5 this qtr and next - you would end up with a 3.748. If you got a 3.0 this qtr and a 4.0 in Spring - you would end up with a 2.7567.

1432,4,"As far as I know, there is no national accreditation for schools.  I understand the Bush administration is looking in to national accreditation.  At present there are a number of regional accrediting groups.  For instance, schools in New Yok are accredited by the Middles States Association of Colleges and Schools.  Certain professional associations also accredit particlular programs given by a college.  For instance, the American Library Association rates library school programs.  So, in a sense, that kind of accreditation is national.  But what you might be talking about are the rankings in U.S. News & World Report.  They do differentiate between ""national"" universities (such as Harvard, Stanford, and Yale) and what they call ""masters"" universities.  This latter group is made up of colleges that are usually less research oriented and mainly attract students from their own region.  Thus they do not have much of a national reputation."
1433,4,"Can versus May\nWhether the auxiliary verb can can be used to express permission or not â ""Can I leave the room now?"" [""I don't know if you can, but you may.""] â depends on the level of formality of your text or situation. As Theodore Bernstein puts it in The Careful Writer, ""a writer who is attentive to the proprieties will preserve the traditional distinction: can for ability or power to do something, may for permission to do it.\n\nThe question is at what level can you safely ignore the ""proprieties."" Merriam-Webster's Dictionary, tenth edition, says the battle is over and can can be used in virtually any situation to express or ask for permission. Most authorities, however, recommend a stricter adherence to the distinction, at least in formal situations.\n\nSo in your example they have separate meanings:\n[1] I can pass the examination. - Here you believe in your ability to pass the exam - you are saying that you will\n[2] I may pass the examination\n - Here may is used in the context of expressing possibility\nsense of possibility in a situation that has not in fact occurred - you are saying that you could or could not pass.  One leaves a hint of uncertainty."

1435,4,"To answer your second question first: Yes, in theory, a student at a $40,000/year school could receive more financial aid than a student at a $10,000/year school. However, there are limits to the amount of federal aid that a student can receive.  Pell grants, for example, are capped at $4050 whether you go to a community college or to a private Ivy League school. Stafford, Perkins, SEOG, and most state aid (just to name a few) are also capped.  As such, the higher cost of a private college can often only be met with private (or PLUS) loan funds or scholarships (from the institution or from outside sources).  \n\nAs for whether you will get much money...\n\nYou might not be eligible for Federal grant aid, but that doesn't mean you can't get some -- or a LOT --  of financial aid, including ""free"" money like grants and scholarships.  Families of all income levels have been known to get large financial aid packages.  If you're a low-need student, your eligibility for aid will probably depend on whether your school gives money for reasons other than financial need.  Broadly speaking, very competitive, prestigious schools aren't hurting for bright, qualified applicants -- so they don't have much reason to ""woo"" wealthy students (when they stand such a good chance of enrolling them anyway).  Instead, these schools often focus on their needier pupils; some have policies stating that they will only give need-based aid (a well known example is Harvard's promise to meet the full need of families with AGIs less than $50K).\n\nThe majority of schools, of course, don't fall into this category.  Many are in direct competition with the above schools and, in order to attract the ""top notch"" applicants will offer merit-based scholarships -- even to students wo don't show need.  \n\nYou know how, when you're applying to schools, they tend to fall into categories ranging from your ""reach"" school to your ""safety"" school? Well, most colleges have to look at applicants the same way: they will have an ""A list"" and a ""B list.""  It often doesn't take a lot of money to enroll a ""B list"" student, but in order to enroll their top-notch students, they may have to go the extra mile -- and sometimes this ""extra mile"" has a lot to do with money...\n\nAll this said, make sure you file the FAFSA regardless of what you *think* you can or can't get.  Many people are surprised.  Your eligibility for Financial Aid depends on a lot more than just your parent's income (or your income).  The EFC formula takes into account where you live; how old your parents are (i.e. how close to retirement they are); how many people there are in your household and, of those people, how many are in college, etc."

From their perspective, the style of dress is just ""who they are.""  (And some of them don't realize that certain aspects of personality don't need to be on display on the job.)\n\nSome teachers dress up out of respect for their topic and for their students.

1473,4,"The first thing you need to know about money for college is that there are two kinds. Free and not free. In other words there are loans and scholarships. You want scholarships first and whatever isn't paid for by those can be covered with loans. To get scholarships some people think you have to be a ""straight A"" student or an exceptional athlete. Although those things do help, they aren't always necessary. You may have certain unique talents and abilities that can earn you scholarships regardless of your grades. Try visiting www.fastweb.com. You can use this site to make a profile and they will e-mail you scholarship opportunities that apply specifically to you! Two kids from my high school won a scholarship for making their prom outfits out of duct tape! True story! Not all of the scholarships are that crazy but again, they don't necessarily relate to grades or sports. If you do have good grades and/or play sports; great! Use that in your profile and they will send you opportunities that apply directly to your talents. It is totally free and there is no limit as to how many scholarships you can apply for and even win. So try to pay for everything you can with scholarships and then you may need to fill in some gaps with loans. Your next stop: www.fasfa.com. There you will apply for financial aid. You will need your most recent W-2 and your parents help when you apply. If you don't have parents or you are over 24 years of age you get to skip the parent section. This site may reward you with some scholarships as well but it's usually mostly government loans. That is why I would suggest applying for dozens of scholarships first.

The issues adressed generally dealt immediatly with slaves. New states admitted to the Union had to be judged as ""slave states"" (slaves allowed) or ""free states"" (slavery prohibited). \n\nBoth sides wanted new states to be whichever side they favored because it would give them more legislative power in the US Congress. This led to bloodshed in many areas, particularly in Kansas, which became known as ""Bloody Kansas"". \n\nIn 1861, South Carolina seceded from the Union (said they werent part of the US any more) and started seizing federal property, including arms and munitions. \n\nOther states started seceding as well. Soon the seceded states formed what they called the ""Confederate States of America"", which came to be headed by Jefferson Davis as President. They attacked Fort Sumner in South Carolina and seized the fort, capturing it's inhabitants. This was treason.\n\nAbraham Lincoln (President of the US) immediatly called for 75,000 troops to put down the uprising. Then the Civil War started, eventually involving millions of troops. 600,000 men eventually died in the conflict, and the US was shattered for decades after the war. Remember, this war was fought to unite the Union, NOT for slavery. In fact, slavery was only addressed in 1862 when Lincoln set forth the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing all slaves in the Confederate states. By 1863 there were armed black soldiers in Union armies, serving with distinction. In 1865 the CSA tried to use black troops, but they were destroyed before the plan could be implemented.\n\nIn 1865 the final Confederate forces surrendered (General Johnston was the last to surrender, but with the surrender of General Robert E. Lee the war was pretty much over). Richmond, VA, the Confederate capital, was seized. \n\nLincoln began steps to rebuild and reunite the US. He planned to be kind to the newly reunited South and not punish them for seceding. Before he could start, he was killed by a man named John Wilkes Booth. \n\nThe years following became years of anger and hate for Southerners. The North oppressed and punished Southern insurrection with high taxes and legal oversight. This period became known as Reconstruction, and it really only ended around the 1970s, one century after it started.\n\nHope I helped,\nThe Wise One\n\nP.S.

1526,4,"You only need to take one, but like me, if you don't know which one to pick, then take both. I'm taking both to see how my scores come out. Here's what you need to know though.\n\n*A good SAT score is generally above a 2000. ""Above average"" is anything above a 1500 (on my PSAT practice I got an 1820). The thing is, that if you want to get into a demanding college, getting a 1700 or an 1800 doesn't seem like anything special. The best scores are higher than 2000. Personally, I feel the SAT requires a lot of reasoning and sometimes the answer is there and you can't see it. People who are good test takers and are not easily duped by ""hidden questions"" tend to get higher SAT scores. Even some smart kids don't do extraordinary because the SAT is not based on what you learn in school, it's more about  how you use your thinking skills.\n\n*The ACT on the other hand is an achievement test. If you have ever taken a standardized test in elementary school or middle school to test how you are up to your grade, it's kind of like that (of course, not the same content...just the way the test is set up). It measures what you've learned and how you can apply it on a test. I find the ACT math and writing sections more fair. A good ACT score is above 30. I did pretty well on my first diagnostic ACT...so I feel that the ACT is for me, but just to be on the safe side I'm taking both.\n\nA lot of colleges demand the SAT. In fact, the SAT is the most famous test for college entrance. But it depends on how you feel. All Ivy Leagues accept either test. It's up to you really. Try taking a practice test, it is the BEST way to know which test you should take."

1562,4,"In its own stead, nothing is bad or good. It is the way it is used, implemented and taken up that makes it bad or good. In India reservation was and is used to please some people and get quick votes, be it SC&ST provisions in constitution which was originally meant for 15 years or implementation of Mandal commission after its lying in cold storage for years. There are many aspects of reservation. It is fact there are some strata of society who need support to rise from their current status of poverty or backwardness. Not all of us who have not seen deprived life know they really know what a backward person faces in her/his life.\nHowever there is opposition for reservation because the benefit of it is are not going to actual people rather they are taken up by some people of these society who are already in upper class whereas actual needy people are still at the same place. No one will object if a really needy get the benefit, Most of people are furious since it is someone who is not needy who is reaping benefit. There are many arguments in this reservation issue:\n1. Instead of caste basis, give it on economic basis: As far as making economic condition as criteria is concerned, there is always good and bad of all thoughts. Good about this will be that this should be the correct way to decide for giving help however there are too many lacunas in this as getting certificate for economic background is very easy to get since no one file income tax return and there is no proof of incomes for people other than salaried people so what will happen ultimately is again people who do not deserve the benefit will get it and needy will remain eluded with this.\n2. Incompetent people in jobs: I agree that when it comes to job then what we need are competent people in jobs to provide proper service and let our country grow. It is wrong to say the people who need help to rise first time are not competent but what is required is that we bring them up and educate and train them so that they are competent enough to take up the challenges. \n3. Would you like a doctor coming through quota to operate on you who does not how to use scalpel: Now if we talk about getting a doctor without enough skills. This is often repeated example but what we fail to understand that a person cannot be a doctor just by getting admission in medical college. S/he became doctor after passing out from the college. If we say that college examination system is such that they will pass person without knowledge then problem does not lie in reservation in admission but in examination system which required to be looked into. Having said that if education system is not good and it will allow person without skill to get the degree then what is guarantee that a person who has come by other route let us by paying higher fees or something and for that matter what is guarantee that a person who have scored 90+ marks is good in medical study. So then we are running risk of many doctors without skills operating on us. So this argument that if the person has come with reservation will be not competent doctor is not correct. If a person has passed MBBS (s/he can be anyone reserve one or other) and do not know how to use scalpel and then we should hung all the teachers who have taught them, people who have set the papers  and all the examiners who has taken their practical exams and checker who checked their examination papers.\n4. What about other type of reservations: why there so much hue and cry about backward class reservations, do everyone really want selection of students on merit basis? if yes, then why there is not no one appear to oppose the other kind of quota called as management quota or nri quota. if all the protest is based on the concept of merit, will the protestant also oppose the private medical and engineering college; giving birth to so called meritorious students by engulfing a big price? \n5. Reservation will take country backward: If that is true then why & how "

The banking system is still relatively weak and the markets are not strong at all. Because of these things, they cannot allow their currency to ""float"" on market forces.\n\nHaving said that, we are in the middle of a shift of economic power to the East and China will be at the center of it. In 20 years, there will be no question who's economy is stronger. China will continue to rise as the US continues to become a marginalized world influence."

Sometimes teachers are misunderstood. I am a teacher myself.  When I was in my twenties, I remember catching a student telling another student that she was sure I hated her.  I was very surprised and had to reflect on why my student thought that way.

But I have also read on other websites that it does not.\n\n""DIOXINS Carcinogens cause cancer. Especially breast cancer. Don't freeze your plastic water bottles with water as this also releases dioxins in the plastic. Dr. Edward Fujimoto from Castle Hospital was on a TV program explaining this health hazard. He is the manager of the Wellness Program at the hospital. He was talking about dioxins and how bad they are for us. He said that we should not be heating our food in the microwave using plastic containers. This applies to foods that contain fat. He said that the combination of fat, high heat and plastics releases dioxins into the food and ultimately into the cells of the body. Dioxins are carcinogens and highly toxic to the cells of our bodies.\n\nThen I found this article from John Hopkins that says it does not\n\n\nBALTIMORE -- Johns Hopkins researchers have responded to an e-mail warning against freezing water bottles. A recent e-mail hoax claims Hopkins scientists warned people that freezing plastic bottles releases dioxins into the water. But the researchers say that's entirely false -- they said freezing plastic water bottles will not expose people to dangerous chemicals.\n\nResults | Disclaimer \n \nAccording to Dr. Rolf Halden, of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, freezing actually works against the release of chemicals and scientists are not even sure plastics contain dioxins. \nHowever, Halden does warn that another group of chemicals that are used to make plastic less brittle can be released if you place them in hot water or heat them in the microwave.\n\nBut Halden stresses that people should not be afraid of drinking water and that ""you are more likely to suffer from the adverse effects of dehydration than from the miniscule amounts of chemical contaminants present in your water supply.""\n\nHe also said people should be more concerned about the quality of the water they drink more than the bottle from which they drink it. Although people tend to assume bottled water is the safest route, Halden said city water is much more highly regulated and monitored for quality."

For example in java, you can call static function just like this:\n\n'ClassA.staticMethod()'\n\nwhereby staticMethod() was declared 'static'.\n\nYou do not have to instantiate an object before using a static method. \n\nStatic function can only access static data because since static function can be used without having to instantiate an object, the data that it accesses has to be readily and statically available. In other words, if a data / field is not declared 'static', it won't be available until an object is instantiated. And if this data is not available until an object is instantiated, then when a static function tries to access a non-static data, it won't be available to the function. Thus, it is a rule that static function can only access static data.\n\nHope it helps."

1744,5,"Computers only understand binary. This is a really clunky way for humans to work. The origional computers were programmed by litterally toggling manual bits on the machine itself. Each generation of languages have sought to make programming easier and more powerfull. \n\nThe way it works is with the programmer. They decide on which language will do the best job for what they are doing. There are some major catagories of these languages.  Compiled vrs interpeted is a major catagory. Which you use depends on your needs. Compiled programs are actually compiled down into the binary codes that will run on your specific OS/Hardware. Interpited programs are compiled to byte code and then when they are run it is ""interpeted"" by a run time lib of some sort which converts the code to actual binary. Compiled programs obviously run faster as they skip the middle man. Interpited programs run on more than a single platform/OS. They also allow for changes on the fly and are more tolerant to upgrades in hardware/OS.  Java, most forms of Basic, Python are some examples of interpited languages. C, Fortran, Assembler are some examples of compiled languages. \n\nSo depending on your language choice you start to code. If you use a third level/functional language you will write out your basic code design and then compile it to byte or binary. If you are using an OOP language there is an extra step in this. Your classes need to be resolved and external dependancies also need to be resolved. Non OOP languages often have dependancies as well but the overhead for them is considerably less. OOP (Object oriented programming) has the advantage of reusing a great deal of code. It's disadvantage is more complex code and slower compile times. The OOP portions are generally either external references or broken down into literal code removing all OOP features from the compiled output. If it is an interpited language it's left as a stub to an external reference. Any other language it's included into the code, depending on the optimization methods generally it's writtin literally into the code on every call. \n\nLets talk about compiling now. Interpited languages compile down into byte code. That means that they create short cut notation for calls to inbuild functions with any your coding tucked in.  When run, this then expands into the dynamic functions with your code describing what to do with these functions. \n\nIn a compiled language the code is first compiled into objects. This is a totally different term from what is an object in code. Most modern compilors hide the obj files from users so you likely will not see or use one of these files today. In the past they were very usefull files at times. Objects are very similer to byte code in nature. They are shortcut notation for what you want to do with the code. \n\nThese objs are OS and version specific. An Obj from a Windows machine will not work on Linux and vice versa. They will contain references to functions that do not exist on the other platforms or have different calling parms and names for example. Other than differences like this there are other distinctions. For example the way memory is addresed and handled is differently in different OS's. The OBJ files have to know and use the specific mem model for that platform. \n\nThe next step is to reference the code. That is you address the functions, resolve dependancies between objects, wrap all your objects into the executable/lib you will be compiling and get it ready for conversion to assembler. \n\nThe assembler takes over from there. It will convert your instructions into Assembler macro instructions. Each computer contains a set of basic instructions that make a comptuer a computer. These calls are the foundations of any language. There are two main approaches to this. One is a richer set of assembler instuctions which is to say that many functions are already built into the bios. The other is to keep it simple and o"

However, it is not that easy. \n\nIf the hacker doesn't have physical access to the computer, he will have to find a way to execute his code on your machine. \n\nBasically, he can do this in two different ways.\n\nThe most commonly used one is simply tricking you into downloading and running his program, which takes control of your computer, giving him the power to delete or do whatever he wants. This can be done through e-mail attachments which pretend to be photographs or videos, and through many other means. You will, however, have to execute the program yourself, either consciously or not.\n\nAnother way, much rarer, is exploting a vulnerability in your Operative System (Generally windows), Internet Explorer (or other browser) or some other program or service. To reduce the chance of this, make sure the potentially risky programs, such as Windows, Internet Explorer, or others programs that are related to Internet are updated. \n\nIf you want to be even more secure, get a good antivirus and good firewall, such as ZoneAlarm (which is free)."

I think the reason you're having problems opening RAW files is because you're using an earlier version of Photoshop.  The way I see it, you've got two options;\n\nOption 1:\nUpgrade to Photoshop CS2.  This is the best but most expensive option.  \n\nOption 2:\nDownload a shareware application like dcRAW-X to convert the RAW files into something Photoshop can work with.  This is the cheapest option but probably won't be good enough for a professional.\nhttp://www.frostyplace.com/dcraw/index.html\n\nIf you're using Photoshop CS or CS2 and getting an error, the reason could be that your camera isn't supported.

1923,5,"First of all, I reccomend you follow your banks advice and cancel the card that is getting charged this monthly fee.  Then have it reissued. It is not difficult, nor is it unpleasent. You just may have to wait a week or two to get your new card in the mail.\n\nNow, I think you should stick up for yourself and get your $60.00 plus any other charges they took from you after you canceled before the 30 day trail period was over. Stop talking to them on the phone, that won't get you anywhere any longer. Find out the address to corperate headquarters and send a registered return receipt required letter, explaining the situation, everything you have done to get this stopped and your money returned. Provide copies of all e-mails justifying your stance that you terminated the service prior to the end of the thirty day trial period. Also, send copies of all e-mail correspondance that shows your efforts to resolve this in a civilized manner and the answers you received from their customer service department. Then tell them you want your money returned to you, as you did not use their service after the 30 day trial period and they have been taking payments for services you did not use. Tell them this is the only letter you will send and that if they do not return your money you will take action with small claims. \n\nOften just sending such a letter, with material to back up your claim, (material that will show a judge they have acted wrongly) will get you your money back. If they don't send you your money apply for relief through small claims.\n\nIt is not difficult to file a small claim. You have to first send out a demand letter, which was what you did in the letter I told you to send. Then you fill out some paper work, usually just a small amount, attach all your proof, ie: your e-mails and bank statement showing amounts taken, and then go to the court date. You tell the judge what you said here and show the e-mails and your bank statement showing the amounts taken. The judge will then look at your proof and render a judgement. If you show all documents which prove you closed this account prior to the thirty day free trial, and the amounts they took illigally, you will win and get that money and your filing fee usually fifteen to thirty dollars. \n\nSince this is a large company you will probably get your money back by just sending out your demand letter. These companies do not like going to court. It costs them more to go to courst than to give you your money back. So, don't be intimidated by them. \n\nIt really is easy. Shut that account down, get your card re-issued, send the demand letter with your e-mails showing you terminated prior to the end of the thirty day free trial, and they will send you a check. It is only in rare cases they won't give your money back. They will not give you your money back if you just do nothing. They will also keep taking that monthly fee if you don't close that card down and have it re-issued. They do this as they know a certain number of individuals won't do anything to stop them as they either don't know how or are too intimindated to take proper action.\n\nShow them you are not one of those individuals and you WILL GET ALL YOUR MONEY BACK. Not just stop the charges from continuing.\n\nOH, sorry, to get the paperwork for a small claim action, just go to your closest court house and ask for the paperwork at the clerks office. The paperwork is usually free of charge. There is often instructions on how to fill them out too.

They are not really into this world cup, but i expect they will not lose too much on Angola at least 1-0 or 2-1\n\n2. Portugal vs Mexico\nAh, this 2 teams. Hard to tell, even everybody is expecting Portugal to win this match. Portugal had a small winning on Angola 1-0 and Mexico had a draw with Angola. Mexico had 1 goal against them, means their defends are not too strong than Portugal without goals against. Even if Portugal wins this match, it will be a close winning maybe 1-0 or 2-0. But if Mexico hit Portugal first then i think Mexico will win this match.\n\n3. Netherlands vs Argentina\nHmm, both have nothing to win / lose at this moment since both are going to the 2nd round. They have another 8 days for them to rest if they really want to take this match slightly easy. Based on the scoreboard, i want Argentina and Portugal to meet each other in the 2nd round. Therefore even if Argentina wins this match, the 3rd round would be easier for them, they have just to beat Mexico, and i'm sure they will win that match.

2045,6,"Angel~\nThe first thing that you should do is research where you are going. Know the terrain and how long you will be hiking. Is is mainly flat? Sandy, beach walking? Up and down hill walking on uneven terrain?  Lots of big rocks or boulders to walk over? I found plenty of websites for Andros Islands, just type it into a yahoo or google search engine.\nHow many miles per day and how many days? Are you camping too?  \nThe best thing you can have on you while hiking are comfortable & supportive shoes or boots.  If you're hiking on uneven terrain where you are steping on rocks or boulders and walking up hill and then back down, boots are probably better than shoes because they keep your ankles from twisting and there is a smaller chance of slipping, and you'll want boots if you are carrying a heavy backpack. You really have to go to a sporting goods store or outdoor clothing outfitter like REI, Adventure 16, Sports Authority, Oshman's, etc... and try the ones on that you like the best. You want to pay attention to comfort and the weight. You will not realize how heavy things are until you're walking long distances.\nI have Salomon hiking shoes, REI trekking boots that I only wear in really rouch terrain\nSecondly, only carry what you'll need. If you're just doing a day hike without camping you won't need much. Hydration packs, like Camelbaks are great because you carry water and the basic essentials in one pack. Or you can use a regular daypack with side pockets to carry 1 or 2 water bottles. You want to stay hydrated while hiking, it is very important for your safety and enjoyment to stay hydrated with water or sports drinks.\nIf you're just hiking for the day you do not need much. Water, hat or bandana to cover your neck or head, sunglasses, snack foods like energy bars or fruit are good, trail mixes are good too. Hiking makes you hungry so make sure you eat before, during, and after the hike. water, water, water too.\nSunscreen in a small container--> skin cancer is silent killer. doesn't matter how dark-skinned or tan you are.\nDo-take out what you bring in to any nature area. \nDon't leave any wrappers or trash\nDon't ever feed animals and respect their natural surroundings. Feeding animals causes them to become less affraid of people and when that happens they can come to too close to people and their lives become compromised...a whole seperate email for that subject.\nDo-Ask your friends what gear they like to use and what they don't like\nDon't-break-in shoes or boots on a long hike.\nMoleskin is a must-drugstores carry it. Use it to cover areas of feet where blisters or hotspots occur.\nIf you have to pee and you probably will- go more than 200 feet away from any water source. It's bad for water quality If you have to poop-dig a hole at least 6 inches deep, 200 feet away from water, and cover it up the best you can.\n\nI could keep going here. Feel free to write me back with further questions. If you can tell me what type of hiking you're doing I may be better able to answer questions.\nHiking is one of my passions in life, it is so rewarding and enjoyable. Have a great time and take pictures always! \nHere are some websites for you to check out.\nLet me know how it goes.\n\nCheers~Erin (California,usa)"

2066,6,"The paddles (bats/racquets whatever) are different colors so that your opponent can tell which side of the paddle your hitting with. \n\nClub level players build their paddles to match their style of play. The rubber can be very tacky for aggressive spin shots (pips-in) or pips-out for defensive shots. The sponge behind the rubber also makes the paddle faster and comes in different thick nesses.  Some rubber is so tacky that if you place a ball on the table and press the paddle to the ball; the ball will stick to the BOTTOM of the paddle when you pick it up. Inversely; if you hit a spin shot at a guy with some of the better pips-out rubbers, it is so pro-spin that it will actually come back with your spin still on it. \n\nSome players use pips-in tacky on their forehand and pips-out on the backhand. \n\nYou can imagine how hairy that would be if you couldnât tell the difference.\n\nSee http://tabletennis.about.com/ or www.paddlepalace.com\n\nGo to www.usatt.org and find a club in your area. Table Tennis is a competitive gentlemanâs game thatâs very warm to new members. I travel all over Ohio and I havenât found a bad club yet.

2070,6,"""If I knew I was going to live this long, I would have taken better care of myself!"" was the most famous quote from perhaps the greatest single talent the game of baseball ever knew.  Mickey Charles Mantle (Oct. 20, 1931 - Aug. 13, 1995).  What Mantle could do on two terribly injured legs was nothing short of incredible.  He played during the era of giant ballparks and dead baseballs.  Still he hit home runs like no other.  Not even Babe Ruth himself could hit a ball further than ""The Mick"".  A great throwing arm, amazing speed and a great teammate.  12 AL pennants and 7 World Series Championships.  And all these prior to free agency.   Can you imagine what his numbers would have been like if he played healthy?  Not even Aaron or Mays would have been able to keep up with Mantle and they played injury free careers.  There was no one better."

He continued to say when you can't talk to people think of something you like to talk about and it'll be easier, then said he breaks the ice by talking about poop.\n\nQ4: A girl wrote in that she loves john cena's free styles and tries to do it too but people say she sucks and she asked how she can improve\n\nA4: He said rap about stuff you know.

2093,6,"Haha, that was me about an hour ago (only I used language not as nice as yours). LoL. I think that the quality of play in this series has been badly tampered because of the whistles being blown during the games. Neither team has been able to play to their full potential, and I would've liked to see STRAIGHT UP BALL instead of a free throw bonanza. The Spurs have played as well as they could under the circumstances (give or take a turnover/missed shot here or there) and I am a firm believer that they could come back just like the Suns did the last round.  One thing is for sure: Dallas is LUCKY. This series could easily be 3-1 Spurs, and if they think Game 5 is going to be a cake walk, they are sorely mistaken! Spurs are the defending champs, and they CERTAINLY won't go down without a fight..! How great that fight actually is...? We'll just have to see Wednesday! =)"

Irons... the higher the number 1 thru  nine...( it won't let me put in 9... must be tipper gore at work again!) works in the same effect.... if you are closer to the hole, you will want to use perhaps an 8 or 9 iron, which will have quite a bit of loft on the shot... or you may want to use a pitching wedge, which will have more loft than the aforementioned clubs... then theres the sand wedge... have I gottan the point accross?"

The best was opening day in KC 2004 when he actually got a stolen base!!!!!!!  That was classic and probably the only one he will ever have."

2131,6,"Ignorance.  I thought it was boring until I was stuck in a small english town with nothing to do in 1982.  I had to watch the world cup, and after a few matches I realized what a great game it is.  Most americans aren't in a position where they have to give it a fair chance, so they watch it for 10 minutes, decide it's boring and change the channel.  I think if they gave it an honest look, a lot more would like it.  But even if I didn't like it now, I wouldn't come here and post smack, I'd let people enjoy what they want to.  For example I don't go to nascar sites and post what I think of it.  \n\nOne thing I'll make no bones about disliking is the faking of injuries. I think that is so lame, and nothing's going to change that.\n\nAnd you may find it interesting to hear that I walked throug north beach san francisco yesterday at lunchtime, a number of cafes were broadcasting the Ukraine-Switzerland match, and they were packed inside and also had tons of people standing on the street looking at the screens inside.  It's growing here, and I think that's going to continue.\n\nI do have to laugh at all these ""US football is wussy/for gays"" etc.  comments.  I can guarantee you everyone posting that would rather meet ronaldinho than any NFL linebacker and call them names to their face."

2133,6,"This time of year it can be hard to trigger strikes - contrary to popular thinking.  I'd use some sort of floating crank that dives to no more than 3-4 ft. upon retrieve.  Anything in a shad color will work since that makes up a significant portion of bass diet this time of year.  If you're fishing over milfoil, cast to the edge, retrieve quickly for the first 3 or 4 feet and then let it float back up to the top.  It simulates a shad scurrying away from the bass which usually makes them come out and hit it.  Stop and go retrieves tend to work really well at this time of year.  If you're hell-bent on using cranks, go for it.  Let me suggest, however, floating worms in the early and late parts of the day.  They are killer here in NC.  Zoom puts out a color called tomatoe that I've had a lot of luck w/ lately.  Don't forget about the trusty ol' buzz bait either, you can usually do some damage w/ one of those if you throw it up to a grassy bank and just slow roll it.\n\nGood luck."

He has great stamina and athleticism to complement his inate talent too.\nSome players have proven tricky for him though.

Again you do have a solid backup in Frye but who is playing against a solid pass defense.  Alex Smith who is solid is playing against a mediocre defense.  \n\nThe possible sleeper Losman is who I went with in one of my leagues.  Just remember Evans and Price, against a week secondary.  Let's not forget he has a RB in McGahee who can draw the onus off from him and his pass game."
2160,6,A central defender doesn't neccessarily need to be quick.ho definately needs to be tall and have good and strong body.he needs good heading and accurate passing.a modern central deffender needs accurate long balls as many times he'll need to push it forward fast in order to make a counter attack.wing deffenders must neccessary be fast and be able to move quick.they need accurate passing (short and long) and good stamina so they can help not only defensing but also attaking!
2161,6,"You can certainly improve at pool.  Since ""good"" is a relative term, I hesitate to use it.  Of course, as a teacher, I'm going to suggest that you seek formal instruction.

He's certainly in the top 10 but how about Sparky Lyle? Rollie Fingers? Dennis Eckersley (the guy LaRussa invented the position for)? Or maybe Goose Gossage, Lee Smith or Bruce Sutter? I agree that Rivera was good but he didn't have a long enough career to be great - for 4 years, unstoppable. Rest of his career, good but not great."

2171,6,"Leave it on and this is how you get around that situation.\n\nYou can go into edit profile for each player which will allow you to switch their position.  You can switch OL to DL and vice versa.  You can switch LB's to HB's and vice versa.  You can also switch WR's with DB's as well.  When you switch them, their overall changes to what it would be at their new position, which is almost always significantly lower then before.  You can drop 99 overall DE's to 40 somethind LG's, sign them to a 7 year, league minimum contract, and then switch them back.\n\nThe only key is to make sure you have depth somewhere at one of those positions so you can make it work.\n\nAlso, a great glitch in the system is the trade deadline move.  If you have a good record (5-0, 4-0, 4-1, 3-1) it is almost always a lock that you can trade your 1st round pick to the team with the worst record (or one of the worst records) at that time for their 1st, 2nd and 4th rounders.  Sometimes it will be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, other times maybe 1st, 3rd, and 4th, but either way, you get extra picks, and you'll move up in the draft."

2187,6,"Here is a simplified definition of American football.\n\nThe object of football is to score as many points as you can.  The team on offense, tries to score the points by getting the ball into the endzone.  They do this by either throwing or handing the ball to a player on their team.  The offensive player with the ball tries to run into the endzone for the score.  The defense tries to prevent this from happening by tackling the offensive ball carrier.  \n\nEach time the offense gets the ball into the endzone, they get 6 points.  After this score, a touchdown, a kicker tries to make an extra point by kicking the ball through the goal posts.  If the offense cannot get the touchdown, or move the ball ten yards forward in 3 tries, on the 4th try they can try to have the kicker kick the ball through the goal posts for 3 points.  If they are too far away, they must punt the ball to the defense, who will become the offense.\n\nThere are 11 players on offense, and 11 on defense.  \n\n(This is my first post, so I don't know how good this will be, but I hope it helps.  I left out many of the more detailed and complicated rules to explain the basic gameplay.)"

AC Milan should stay a major club but might start not doing as well when their veterans all stop playing. When I last checked majority of the players in their tems were over 30 years of age. Big up side for Inter Milan is Adriano, watch out for him at the world cup, he has amazing skills, powerful shot, strong, fast and great in the air. AC Milan (2nd) are only 5 points ahead of Inter in the Serie A in 3rd position. They are both in the quarter finals of Champions League.

A team can suit up 20 players for a game and each team places 6 players on the ice at a time:\n1 Goaltender (who has the job of defending a goal), 2 defensemen, 2 fowards (Left Wing and right wing), and 1 center ice man. Players can come in and out of the lineup on the fly as often as they like.\n\nThere are 3 twenty minute periods in a hockey game followed by a 5 minute sudden death OT if required. If the teams are still tied at the end of OT , they have what is known as a shootout - where players take alternating breakaway shots at the opposing goaltender.\n\nWhichever team scores the most goals wins (each goal is worth a single point). \n\nPlayers are allowed, and in fact are encouraged to use physical contact, called checking, while playing the game. Players are not permitted to hold, grab, use their stick to obstruct or check a player that does not have the puck. If they do so they will get a penalty which is typically 2 minutes (though can be 5 minutes for fighting or a major intent to injure penalty). During that time, his team plays shorthanded with one less player as he serves his penalty."

2273,6,"EDIT:\n\nOk so it looks like your from Australia and not the U.K.  Since no one else seems to be helping you out maybe I can clear some things up for you.\n\nIt sounds like you don't have too much experience with firearms and that's understandable seeing that you come from Australia.  I've read that Austria has some pretty messed up gun laws.  Not quite as bad as the U.K. but pretty close.  Unfortunate but thatâs the way it is.  \n\nI'll try to address some of your concerns and give you some answers to your problems without getting too in-depth.  My knowledge comes from my military background and the fact that as I hobby I enjoy collecting and shooting firearms.\n\nFirst letâs look at commercially available body armor.  In America there are six different categories of body armor recognized by the National institute of justice and the military.  Iâll list them verbatim below. \n\nLevel I -  Level I vests protect officers from .22 caliber pistol rounds or long rifle rounds and .38 caliber  rounds.\n \nLevel II A â Protects against all lower levels and 9mm    rounds and 357 magnum rounds and 40 S&W rounds in the lower range.\n\nLevel II - Protects against all lower levels and 9mm rounds and 357 magnum rounds and 40 S&W rounds in the higher range.\n\nLevel III A â Protects against all lower levels and also 9mm rounds with velocities up to 1400 ft/s and .44 caliber rounds and .44 magnum rounds with speeds up to 1400 ft/s.\n\nLevel III- The first vest level that mandates use of a heavy, bulky hard plate with the soft body armor to protect the wearer from rifle rounds.  Soft armor absorbs some of the rifle trauma to minimize injury to the wearer.  This level vest must withstand 6 shot from 7.62 x 51 NATO ball ammo that travels up to 2800 ft/s.  (this is what troops in Iraq are wearing).\n\nLevel IV â Level 4 vests are also hard body armor and are designed to protect itâs wearer from one shot of a high caliber steel core projectile up to 30-06 traveling at 2900 ft/s.\n\n\n So if you buy commercially available body armor youâll want to get at least level II but hopefully youâll be able to get Level III A that will basically protect you from almost all pistol rounds and most rounds fired out of submachine guns.  Anything higher then that probably wonât be worth the increase in bulk, weight, and price.  Because from your question it sounds like if you face an armed robber he will most likely be wielding a pistol.\n\nAs for your question about the meaning of FMJ that abbreviation means: full medal jacket.  The two most commonly used kinds of ammunition are full medal jacket (FMJ) and jacketed hollow point (JHP).  From the position of a shooter each has itâs distinct advantages.    \n\nA bullet that is FMJ is composed of a solid lead core usually coated with copper to prevent excessive barrel wear and increase lubrication of the firearm.  Believe it or not when copper is used in stainless steel machinery it acts as a natural lubricant.  The advantage of FMJ in a defensive situation over JHP is penetration.  That is that it goes though things a lot easier.  So for example if you have to shoot someone and they dive for cover, if your bullet is FMJ it is more likely to go though whatever is infront of your target and into that person.  By the same token if someone is wearing inferior body armor a FMJ bullet is more likely to penetrate their body armor and go in deep enough to hit a vital organ.  You can find a picture of a 9mm Full medal jacket bullet here: http://www.cnccartridge.com/9mm115reman.jpg .\n\nA bullet that is made as a Jacketed Hollow Point (JHP) is similarly constructed.  But instead of being solid it is hollow in the middle.  The purpose of this is so that when it goes inside someoneâs body it will âmushroomâ and expand.  Creating a larger wound channel, promoting more and faster blood loss, and damaging ones internal organs more severely then a FMJ bullet would.  The downside to this"

2279,6,"Stewart went on to start with the Chicago Bears, who were in a transitional period and rebuilding. After several poor performances in 2003, he was replaced by rookie Rex Grossman and again released at the end of the season. Stewart was signed in 2004 by the Ravens to play a backup role to Kyle Boller as a replacement for the injured Anthony Wright, and did not throw a pass (though he was unexpectedly successful as an emergency replacement for punter Dave Zastudil). He was even named NFL Special Teams Player of the Week for his performance as a punter. He was released following the 2004 season, but due to an injury to starting Quarterback Kyle Boller during week 1 of the 2005 season, the Ravens once again signed Stewart to be a backup to Anthony Wright.\n\nFollowing Boller's reactivation on Wednesday, November 9, 2005, the Ravens cut Stewart instead of keeping him as a third-string player, activating running back Musa Smith instead. Stewart had no comment to make following the low-key announcement of his removal.\n\nStewart was no doubt a very gifted athlete who could play a number of positions well. Some people, including Steelers President Dan Rooney, speculated that had Stewart remained in the ""slash"" role, he could have been a superstar. While he never made it to the Super Bowl, he was instrumental in taking the Steelers to two AFC Championship games in 1997 and 2001, and paved the way for the several ""slash"" type players and mobile quarterbacks who followed (e.g. Michael Vick, Donovan McNabb, Daunte Culpepper, and Steve McNair)."

The dilemma would be when you start the playoffs and if you are going to make the playoffs in your league.  The fact that Indy is undefeated might mean that there star players are going to sit, not only in the last game, but maybe other games depending on when they clinch their division.  Considering the fact that Detroit and Buffalo will be fighting the rest of the season to even get in the playoffs, they will be playing their star players every week.

2303,6,"As much as Kumble has been a star for India, you can't go past Warne, the best leg spinner the world had produced.\n\nKumble 510 wickets at average 28.76 in 106 Tests\nWarne 685 wickets at average 25.25 in 140 Tests.\n\nThe big difference is where they play.  India has spinner friendly wickets at every ground, whereas Australia only really has one of these amongst its 5 main Test playing venues.\n\nIn 2000 Warne was rated among the five greatest cricketers of the 20th century.  In 2005 he was bowling better than ever.\n\nHe revived legspin, thought to be extinct, and is now pre-eminent in a game so transformed that we sometimes wonder where the next champion fast bowlers will come from. \n\nKumble if he played better away from India, may well rank alongside Warne.  He's improved away in recent years but his average away from India is still only 37.64 compared to Warne's away average of 25.50 (almost same as in Aus).\n\nAdd this to the actual art of leg-spin - spinning the ball towards the batsman's legs, and you will see why Warne is # 1.  Warne is a ripping leg spinner, whereas Kumble deceives you in flight with a kick rather than a high flighted leggie."

Pacman and Roach called it correctly that Morales would try to finish the match early because he fears he wouldn't have the stamina for an extended battle.\n\nBarrera however is a different case.  Remember when Pacman beat him the first time, it wasn't a knock down.  The man was standing when his corner threw in the towel.  I'm guessing this means he can take Pacman's punches (although it reduced him to a punching bag).\n\nI think Pacman will get UD victory over Barrera this time.

As I recall, Pacman did ask for a rematch and it was Marquez who said no.  But in any case, I am willing to concede that Pacman might have lost that fight.  But he has learned a lot since.  He came into that fight overconfident thinking that he has nothing left that needs improvement.  But that fight and the fight against Morales showed him what the skills are that he lacked."

2327,6,"Ultimately you, your coach, and your parents/guardians should make this decision.\n\nThat said, one mistake I've seen often made by talented young athletes is ""playing up"".  Whether it was a 10 year old playing on an under-12 soccer team or a high school ball player jumping to the NBA, the results on the whole aren't good for the athlete.  The young player's playing time is cut dramatically, they're also behind in terms of overall skill, so they're playing catch up to a degree, plus the aspects of socializing with people more mature than yourself is another gap to bridge.\n\nAlso, team environment/chemistry can play an immense role in how you perform.  My two worse experiences with basketball came with two teams where one had zero tolerance for mistakes, and the other placed a premium on winning at all costs while having no camaraderie.  It was no surprise, now reflecting back that for the first time in my life, I disliked playing ball, and struggled with my overall play.\n\nMy advice is to stick with your team, grow with them.  Varsity will be there later, and you'll probably be better prepared for it when it's time.  Good luck."

He is a 10-time World Champion: 4-time WWE Champion, 1-time Undisputed Champion and 5-time World Heavyweight Champion.

Along with Shawn Michaels and Chyna, he was a member of one of the most popular stables in wrestling history, D-Generation X in 1997. Around the same time, he reduced his alias to Triple H.

2382,6,"Please find Heather Jeffries, M.P.A opinion here:\n\nMost cheerleaders say âYESâ while state and school officials say âno.â According to the National Federation of High School Athletic Associations, seventeen to twenty states of the United States consider cheerleading a sport. Why is the question, âIs cheerleading a sport?â such a controversial issue to anyone not involved with the sport? According to MSN Encarta, the definition of sport is an individual or group competitive activity involving physical exertion or skill, governed by rules, and sometimes engaged in professionally. Because cheerleading follows every aspect defined under the word sport, it is my belief that cheerleading should be defined as an actual sport.\n\nThe word cheerleader no longer means a sideline of squads that exist solely to support other sporting teams. Cheer teams are teams in their own right. College and high school cheer teams compete\nfor national titles just as football, basketball, baseball, etc. Cheerleaders are recruited for college scholarships that have been known to exceed amounts awarded to other sports teams. Some cheer teams put in more hours in the gym than teams such as football and basketball. Cheerleaders have to be in just as good physical condition as any other sport participant.\n\nCheerleading in the early years was nothing like the sport it is today. Over the past few decade cheerleading has evolved from leading audiences with simple arm movements to treacherous towers of humans and elaborate dances that are used to show the athleticism of cheerleaders. Cheerleading has developed from selections based on popularity to one that now claims some of the more talented athletes in the school/program.\n\nCheerleaders are not seen as athletes, but seen as being athletic. Cheerleaders are very specialized athletes. Most do not understand the skill and athleticism required by cheerleading. The gymnastics ability, power and strength make cheerleaders some of the more wellrounded athletes in sports. Cheerleading not only teaches coordination and helps condition competitors, but it also teaches teamwork, leadership, communication skills, organizational skills, productivity and much more.\n\nCheerleading contributes to the overall physical fitness of those involved. Many teams are in the gym four to six days a week working out, practicing, stretching and conditioning for upcoming performances or competitions. Running increases oneâs lung power and endurance. Stretching, jumping, taking gymnastics and aerobics all help keep the body toned and healthy. So as you can see, cheerleading practice and workouts are much like those of other sports.\n\nWhen it comes to funding issues, the sport of cheerleading is not equally supported. Monies are contributed to sports that do not consistently perform well. Cheer teams that do perform well usually do not receive the monetary compensations for their performances. Scholarships, donations from alumni, and extra funding to the school rarely get distributed to the cheer programs. Programs known for winning national titles over several years occasionally receive monies. I believe this occurs only once the administration realizes the need to keep those athletes in their program. Cheerleading does not bring the revenue to schools like football games; however, the publicity that some cheer teams contribute to the school can be profitable in other ways.\n\nAs a former cheerleader myself, I remember having long and strenuous practices which seemed to last forever. Because my life was so into cheerleading, I did and still consider cheerleading a sport. I have always told people who Iâve talked to about cheerleading that I consider it to be a sport. After being exposed to the competitiveness of cheerleading, I stand stronger behind my beliefs in the sport of cheerleading.\n\nBeing a co-owner and one of the head coaches for Clarksville Cheer Extreme, an all star cheerleading gym in Clarksville, Tenn"

2386,6,"In normal time Argentina was dominating the game, with tight defense and interesting scoring opportunities. Germany was able to get some scoring opportunities, specially from crossings, nothing new actually.\n\nBut Jose Pekerman wanted to strength defense and keep a 1-0 win, and put Cambiasso instead of Riquelme, the offensive power lost there. Then Argentina's great goalie got hurt and had to be replaced by the other guy, who I never saw playing.\n\nThen he made an stupid move by making his last substitution, taking away Crespo and putting some other guy I don't know.\n\nGermany drawed, with a goal given to Klose, probably to get the most goals, with a head crossing and Klose finished with a good heading. He was being completely useless so far because of Argentina's great defense, and the goalie didn't jump to get that ball, which the main goalie would CERTAINLY get it before close, since the head-crossing was slow.\n\nArgentina lost because their keeper got hurt imho, I feel relieved we will face Germany in the finals now though, I thought the game would be even but Argentina played alot better, Germany got lucky, very lucky. Brazil will not put their best offensive players out, and the german defense looked very confused against a strong team."

If she breaks any of the promises she's made, she will have 14 days (or whatever) to move out.\n5.  Be firm but kind.  Tell her that if she has to leave because she breaks the contract that you'll be heartbroken, but that she has to understand that you are now both bound to this contract.\n\nIf this sounds useful, you may want to do this with the help of your/her therapist.\n\nGood luck!"

2413,7,"Find out from the government what your overall RRSP limit is (it's part of the letter they send you after you send in your tax return and you can also get it by phone and on-line). Then, contribute as much as you can afford to your RRSP, until you hit that limit.  You'll get a refund that is in proportion to your tax bracket for the money you've invested in your RRSP - if you are in a 30% tax bracket you will get back 30% of what you invested.  Take that money that you get back as a tax refund and re-invest it in your RRSP until you reach your max (which will likely be tens of thousands of dollars).  \nIt's great that you've paid off your mortgage, but you've been missing out on the miracle of compound interest for years and need to start making up for that.\nTake a money management course and get a self directed RRSP account from somewhere like TDWaterhouse and start to invest in a diversified way (no more than 10% of your portfolio in any one investment) and you will be well on your way.  \nAlways remember that no one will take care of your money as well as you will, so don't fall prey to financial advisors who just want to sell you products that make them money.  Keep your MER's low and NEVER invest in a fund with a load!\n\nGood Luck!"

It is never easy to deal with a breakup, but you must find the strength to move foward.  I think we need to take time to heal and jumping right into another relationship isn't the answer.  However, going out with friends and maybe even meeting the guy your friends are encouraging you to meet may not be such a bad idea.  Just don't move to fast too soon, and make decisions for all the wrong reasons.  Things happen for a reason and not every person that we are with is the person that is our life partner, you don't want someone in your life that you can't trust, nor do you want a cheater.

Astronomically speaking, the sun begins in the constellation of Libra, passes through Scorpius from approximately the 24th through the 29th and ends in the constellation of Ophiuchus, which is the only zodiacal constellation that is not counted as an astrological sign.\n\nThe name is from the Latin novem for ""nine"". November was the ninth month in the Roman calendar until a monthless winter period (summer in the southern hemisphere) was divided between January and February.\n\nIn old Japanese calendar, the month is called Shimo tsuki (éæ)."

Hedge funds, generally speaking, operate outside the disclosure and protection laws (except for true fraud).  Still because they are outside the disclosure laws, true fraud may be impossible to detect.  And some forms of fraud in the common sense understanding are written into the contracts and so are not fraud in the legal sense.  It is fraud if they illegally cheat you not if you contract away common sense rules.  Some of the abuses should be reigned in, but they cannot be because they are legal and contractual rights of the managers."

Wipe down the board with a sponge and hot, soapy water immediately after use. (Image 1)  \n  \n2.   Get rid of minor stains by sprinkling table salt on the affected area and rubbing the area with a lemon wedge.  \n  \n3.   Use an abrasive antibacterial cleaner and scouring pad for tougher stains. (Image 2)  \n  \n4.   Rub the board with fine sandpaper to get rid of severe stains. Be sure to rub along the grain of the wood. (Image 3)  \n  \n5.   Rinse the board well.  \n  \n6.   Wipe off excess water with a clean towel and lean the board against a countertop to allow for even drying.  \n  \nTips:  \n Clean your cutting board after each use for sanitary purposes.  \n  \n To maintain an attractive finish, use a food-safe mineral oil to polish your cutting board.  \n  \n  \n  Warnings:  \n Don't leave a wooden cutting board in standing water. Doing so will cause the wood to split.  \n\n\n\nOlive oil is not recommended for use on wooden cutting boards. It becomes rancid. Seal the wood with food-grade mineral oil, especially before the first use. Use mineral oil once a week, or when needed. To clean the board and get a sanitary surface, scrub the board under hot running water, then wash it with hot, soapy water. Wipe it with a solution of one part vinegar to four parts water. Rinse it with running water and pat it dry (or allow it to air-dry)."

In other words, the more money a particular fund has, the larger any particular position has to be to make an impact on the funds results.  A $10 million investment, no matter how well it does isn't going to have much impact on a $50 billion fund.  The larger the fund, the larger the investments needed to make a difference.  The larger the minimum investment, the smaller number of choices a particular fund manager has, and theoretically, the less well he'll be able to do."

2491,7,"First of all there are more than 13000 mutual funds out there. How do you know which one is best for you? This is where the broker comes in. He/She will be able to filter through all of the different available funds and make a recommendation for you based on your risk tolerance level, investment time horizon, and overall suitability of the investment based on your investment needs. This is what you are paying for is the professional advice. The broker will be able to save you time by doing due diligence research on the type of fund and or funds that best meet your investment objective by looking at the past track record of the funds, morningstar rating, and internal cost of ownership of the funds. Of course past performance is not indicative of future results, however having a professional on your side can help you come to a more informed decision on deciding which fund best fits your individual needs.\n     As for the latter part of your question, I am a little confused.\nYes , brokers do get paid a commission. This is how they earn a living. The broker has to spend time doing a detailed client profile on you, and then do the necessary research to find out which investments fit your needs best. This is what you are paying for..... the service. Sure you can go out and try to pick your own funds, many people do, some very successfully. However many people don't have the know how or want to invest the time to do this. This is where brokers/financial advisors come in."

2496,7,"Well, sure.  I mean, they've violated their contract, if nothing else, but normally there are specific labor laws that cover those issues too, so they may not even need to sue in court.  \n\nBigger issue is this: if your friend works for a company that isn't making their payroll on time, it's time to start looking for a new job.  I mean, it's possible that the company may survive their financial trouble, but not usually.  And, actually, trying to get some kind of judgment or conviction against the company will probably work against him, too.  Legal action would probably just cause the company to close its doors sooner, which means your friend would be out of work right away, instead of giving him a few weeks or months to find a new job.\n\nYou don't want to take action just because you can.

2531,7,"Taking your questions one at a time:\n\n1) It doesn't necessarily mean that other stores are not hiring, so you should definitely go door to door and ask them (nicely). What do you have to lose?\n\n2) Khaki pants and a button-down short should be perfectly acceptable for a sales position in a mall (whereas they wouldn't if you were applying for, say, a job in a law firm.)\n\n3) If you ask them if they are hiring, and they say yes, they will probably give you an application there. I'd suggest that you say thank you, and take it home with you to fill out carefully, although if it's simple enough you could also do it on the spot (but keep in mind that this is your first impression you're making, so it's probably much better to be neat, careful and thorough than it is to be fast.)\n\n4) It would probably be unusual for them to interview you on the spot, although it certainly could happen if they have an urgent need for staffers.\n\n5) Absolutely bring your resume with you (but again, make triply sure that it is neat, professional-looking, and most importantly that everything is spelled correctly).

2533,7,"You are talking of three different things -- sole proprietorship, partnership and incorporation. Each of these legal structure has their pros and cons, and they have tax implications, liabilities, among others. Your goal should be to choose one for you.\n\nThe article ""Choosing the Legal Structure of Your Small Business""  http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol3/legalstructure.htm spells out the advantages and disadvantages of each legal structure. For sole proprietorship, while it is easy to form, you also assume unlimited liability. With partnership, while more heads are better than one, you have to share the profit (which may not seem so bad since your partner is your wife anyway). For corporations, while ownership may be easily transferable in the event the owner leaves the business, there is double taxation.\n\nOne thing to consider when doing business with your spouse is to have a ""buy-sell"" provision to address what happens to the partnership in the event of a partner's death, divorce, disability, bankruptcy, resignation or retirement. That can cover a lot of confusion in the event the partnership (or marriage) dissolves.\n\nI work with my husband in our limited liability company, and things are going very well. But we do have very specific provisions in our partnership agreement - from sharing of profit to any other eventualities."

I mean if you are dissatisfied with the previous work, please tell them so. But also tell them why you are interested in this particular line which you chose now. Being truthful and frank helps a lot in such cases.\n\nb) Hmmm...so if you have no experience in the current industry which you chose, tell them to take you on a trial-basis and judge your skills. But you have to work hard and prove yourself upto their expectations. Now that wont be tough.\n\nc) Well...as a matter of fact...everyone starts right from under and then works out to the top. For example, Mr.Dhirubhai Ambani in India has nothing to start a multi-national company like Reliance in the beginning. Azim Premji of Wipro Corp. used run edible oil business in the beginning. Bill Gates didn't have millions of dollars to start Microsoft. Everyone started small...but they grew big with their talent and their imagination. So starting on a lower position of job is nothing bad...you wil be promoted fast if you have the stuff in you...All The Best!\n\nd) Now in this case be frank and tell him what you are good at. If you are not so good in anything, tell them so and Do promise to improve. I think they will understand your zeal.\n\ne) Tell them how you are going to contribute to the progress of their firm. Tell them your merits and demerits and what they can expect from you and don't forget to live upto their expectation and your promises.\n\nSo All The Best with your career and i wish you a grand success\n\nrule wid style n luv@vinny"

If there are not any Mary Kay dealers in your area you may be able to do great at it.  It's all about the demand.  I wish you luck.

There might also be state taxes involved, which again would be paid by the estate.\n\nIf you inherit assets, like stock or property, when you sell them you'd owe capital gains taxes on how much they've appreciated since you inherited them.

2599,7,"The artificial cultivation of sponges has been found to be biologically feasible, although little or no commercial success has resulted locally from attempts at this because of various setbacks. The method generally adopted was to fasten small blocks of sponge to cement disks an inch thick and ten inches in diameter. Under normal conditions regeneration begins almost immediately and the cut piece soon adheres firmly to the base. Although a sponge is a marine animal, fragments or âcuttingsâ will grow like plants and reach marketable size in about 4 years. From 1935 to 1939 more than 140,000 velvet and wool sponges were raised by the Bahamas government on protected planting grounds off Andros Island; 800,000 more at Turneffe Lagoon, east of Belize. In both localities the sponges were almost completely wiped out by a blight. Since this time the farming has not been resumed."

2684,7,"CORPORATION\n--------------------\nWhat sets the corporation apart from all other types of businesses is that a corporation is an independent legal and tax entity, separate from the people who own, control and manage it. Because of this separate status, the owners of a corporation don't use their personal tax returns to pay tax on corporate profits -- the corporation itself pays these taxes. Owners pay personal income tax only on money they draw from the corporation in the form of salaries, bonuses and the like.\n\n\nLIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES\n-----------------------------------\nLimited partnerships are usually created by one person or company, the ""general partner,"" who will solicit investments from others -- who will be the limited partners.\n\nThe general partner controls the limited partnership's day-to-day operations and is personally liable for business debts (unless the general partner is a corporation or an LLC). Limited partners have minimal control over daily business decisions or operations and, in return, they are not personally liable for business debts or claims.\n\nCOMPARISONS\n----------------\nLLCs are similar to corporations because they also provide limited personal liability for business debts and claims. But when it comes to taxes, LLCs are more like partnerships: the owners of an LLC pay taxes on their shares of the business income on their personal tax returns.\n\nCorporations and LLCs make sense for business owners who either 1) run a risk of being sued by customers or clients or run the risk of piling up a lot of business debts, or 2) have a good deal of personal assets they want to protect from business creditors."

These two instances are:\n\n1. In the case of the president, whenever the bylaws provide that the president shall be an ex-officio member of all committees (except the nominating committee); and\n2. If the ex-officio member is not a member, officer, or employee of the society (for example, when the governor of a state is made ex officio a member of a private college board).\n\nHowever, it should be emphasized that in these instances the ex-officio member still has all of the rights and privileges of membership, including the right to vote.

There used to be a company that set up trusts that claimed to make them immune from taxes but they arrested the people involved and all the others that had set up those trusts.\nYes! Setting up a trust can effectively make your assets immune from creditors and judgements IF you appoint someone other than yourself as the trustee. In other words, you cannot control the assets in the trust or they can be attached after a judgement.

By dumping shares into the market and by them no longer adding demand buy buying, they add supply and reduce demand causing the entire market to fall in price.  Since mutual funds are usually broadly diversified holders of a sizeable segment of the market, the mutual fund's price falls with everyone elses.\n\nThe profit was taken by someone else, not you and by the time you found out about it, it was gone.\n\nDON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

Then ask them to link to your blog.\n\nOther shoestring strategies for marketing for free a blog or website:\n\n1. Create the best content you can with the best products you can possibly offer. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.\n\n2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. If only 10 people go to your site, but these 10 people invite 10 more - that's additional traffic that you get for FREE!\n\n3. Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.\n\nIf you are going to read only one piece on search engine optimization, I suggest you read Brett Tabke of WebmasterWorld.com's ""Successful Site in 12 Months with Google Alone: 26 steps to 15k a day."" http://www.webmasterworld.com/forum3/2010.htm \n\n4. Send out press releases. While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News. My website (see my profile) accepts free press release submission (no strings attached!)\n\n5. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. If 50 websites publish your article and it contains a link back to your website, then you easily get 50 links from a single article. The more links you have, the greater your chances for increasing your search engine rankings."

2788,7,"Yes Very Easy,\n\nMany rational arguments exists, however I will show you one such argument:\n\nWhen one observes the Universe, it can be seen that the Universe is ordered, and this order is regulated by laws. These laws are what we call the laws of Physics, others refer to them simply as the laws of nature. \n\nA fundamental question arises, who or what established these laws? Did they create the Universe that they govern or did the Universe create them so as to bring order to itself?\n\nNeither case can be logically possible, since matter in the Universe is dependent on the laws that govern it, and the laws are a function of matter. Therefore there must be something independent of both matter and the natural law that created them.\n\nIt is the Creator, the only one who is unlimited, self-subsistent and eternal that is worthy of being worshipped.

You were nothing i.e. dead, so the correct order is lifer AFTER death and not the other way round like some people assume. So it is incorrect to say that no one has come back from death, since everyone that has life has come from death.\n\n\nI hope that helps\n\nAnhar Hussain Miah"

By doing something that would make her crumble, you yourself will be a part of that mess and would not be pleasant if it was known that you did something or that you had even plotted against her. Eventually, she will reach a breaking point since nobody is truly perfect (no matter how close it seems). She probably has already annoyed other people to the point of abandonment.\n\nOverall, just ignore her. Try and try. You need to be the one to take her place :]"

Keep the lines of communicatin open and clear so that if the team leader needs anything, he/she will not hesitate to express these concerns or issues.  Express your genuine to desire to want to help and if he/she is a good team leader, everything will fall into place.  This is not a one-sided relationship.  You could put forth 150% effort to be of assitance but if your team leader sucks, ultimately, your efforts would have been for nothing."

2825,8,"the books were written by Clive Staples Lewis, who was a Christian man and did a great deal of religious writing, like the Screwtape Letters.  By the way, that's a really good book.  You can see a great deal of religious themes in his books, such as in the first book, The Magician's Nephew, with the apple in the garden that he must take because Aslan bid him to, and not eat one himself or take one for his sick mother, as Jadis tells him to.  That would be the story of the Fall, Jadis being the Serpent.  Also, in the Last Battle, the seventh book in the series, there is that whole thing with Tash, the god of Calormen, and Aslan, the deity of Narnia. It's hard to explain, you'll just have to read, but it does look like it was influenced by the author's views on religion.  In The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe, we see the theme of faith without proof, a key in religion, in the part with Lucy and Tumnus and the others who don't beleive in Narnia at first.  Then when Aslan sacrifices himself to save Edmund,it is like Jesus dying to save us from hell.  He rises from the Stone Table as Jesus rose from the cave they sealed him in.\n\nHowever, C. S. Lewis has stated himself that he in no way intinded The Chronicles of Narnia to come across as religious works, merely a series of fairy tales written for Lucy, his neice or something like that.\n\nI think, however, that because he was such a religious man and had written a great deal of religious works, that in his tales, he subconsciously weaved a storyline that was very familiar to him, that of religion.  He wanted to make a good tale, and his subconscious mind associated religion with that, and thus the seemingly religious parts in his books.\n\nBut he did not intend, at least this is what he said, for Aslan to come across as a depiction of Jesus."

Five minutes later, the blonde walks outside again to check her mailbox. Seeing that there is nothing in it, she walks back inside her house. Another five minutes later, the blonde comes back outside to check her mailbox. After watching the blonde check her mailbox 3 times in a row, the guy is pretty curious. When she starts to walk back inside again, he asks, ""What are you doing?"" \nShe says, ""My computer keeps telling me that I've got mail.""\n\nThere were three women, a brunette, a red head, and a blonde who were trying to break the world record for fastest time to swim across the English Channel doing only the breaststroke.

Anakin in the dream is not the movie character, but someone you know whom you deeply care about. Perhaps you feel this person is ""going down a path you can't follow"" or changing from the wonderful person they used to be. If you can figure out who it is, try and make peace with them by letting them know you are concerned. Or, possibly, Anakin is yourself and you don't like who you are becoming.\n\nHope that helped."

This will make the session more enjoyable as well as challenge you to learn different techniques, rhythms, chord structures, and familiarize yourself with your own abilities and limitations.  This will speed you along faster than practice alone and reward you when you are actually able to play a bass line.\n\nDon't worry about spending money on high-end equipment until you feel you need to invest in it.  Go to a pawn shop, used music store, or classifieds for used bass heads and amps.  You will find some good deals, and many used amps actually sound better than new equipment because it has aged and been played.  New equipment tends to sound ""new"" and may take time to break in.  Take your bass with you when you try out amps, most places don't mind and actually encourage you to try out different amps."

2992,8,"What's the best aspect of the Cancer-Leo relationship? Their mutual commitment to a sincere relationship. Together this pair can share a supportive, positive and healthy vibe. People see them as a winning combination, and their mutual desire for a secure, loving relationship makes them strive for harmony.\n\n\n\nhere s in detail...Leo & Cancer \n\nWhen Cancer and Leo make a love match, they understand and know how to satisfy basic emotional needs within one another. Both these Signs require dedication and tender, loving care, but while Cancer seeks stability and emotional harmony, Leo craves heartfelt compliments and sincere admiration. Both are strongly loyal, even to the point of possessiveness, Cancer for safety's sake, Leo for the sake of their self-confidence. They are also both committed to a enduring, rewarding connection. Since their desires are similar, a Cancer and a Leo may fill very important voids in each other's lives.\n\nBoth Leo and Cancer prefer comfort and security, and they prefer both on a grand scale. Cancer and Leo enjoy a lovely home and a close-knit family. Leo provides the flair and the passion, and Cancer brings to the home a sensitive but intense instinct to nurture. Leo is the bigger and bolder and more vivid of this couple, the picture of majesty and status. Because both Signs are so strong-minded, these two must always work attentively to understand and accept one another.\n\nThe intense and emotional Moon (Emotion) rules Cancer, while the bright, bold Sun (the Self) rules Leo. The Sun is about ego and self, radiating warmth and light, and vibrant Leo indeed radiates this kind of energy and enthusiasm. The Moon concerns itself with nurturing, with creating and maintaining emotional connections. This combination of masculine and feminine energy is why the Sun and the Moon adore and sustain one another other as they do. The Sun represents life, and The Moon cultivation and growth; as long as they are mindful of their inherent differences, their combination can be a positive one. \n\nCancer is a Water Sign, and Leo is a Fire Sign. Leo strives with an ardent energy toward praise and appreciation, while Cancer yearns more for security and stability. Both Signs like to take charge, but they come at a leadership role from very different directions. No small number of disputes can rise from this difference. As long as Cancer and Leo never take for granted their relationship, as long as they reassure one another in practical and romantic ways that this relationship is important to both of them, they can usually find a happy medium. \n\nCancer is a Cardinal Sign, and Leo is a Fixed Sign. Under stress, Leo becomes opinionated and stubborn, and Cancer can act as a subtle manipulative force. Cancer's the persistent initiator of shared plans, and Leo channels their energies and works doggedly to move plans to completion. If given the choice, the Crab would choose a calm and stable life, having no need for glamour or acclaim. Leo, on the other hand, loves to shake things up and embraces the unexpected and the novel. Though a Leo and a Cancer may commit emotionally to a relationship, each of them can continue to follow their natural instincts AND devote themselves thoroughly and completely to one another. If, however, they haven't made their love intentions clear to one another, they may find themselves on a never-ending emotional roller coaster ride. Cancer, hiding behind that innocent shell of theirs, can be the more quietly controlling of this pair and might -- to a degree -- manipulate their Leo loved one when it seems practical to do so."

After meeting with Derek they went to pick up the Chief and then George who Izzie sent off like a little boy. Meredith told Derek ""I hope you are enjoying your space."" Preston admits that George was his idea. Next they end up at Joes and pick up Joe and his lover. Suddenly Alex appear and George say that was not my idea.\n\nBack at the hospital that leaves the women in charge, in particular Bailey who assigns Meredith to Mark, Izzie to Lindsey, the resident who took her place that one week, and Christina she kept for herself and made her plw through poop for monopoly pieces in punishment for erasing her name off the surgical board.\n\nIn another room Callie is called on for a consult by Addison. This lady has broken her wrist. Callie puts it in suspension. Addison excuses herself and goes to cry. Callie finds her to see what is up and learns that the baby is dead and she has to tell the lady on the table what has happened. She says it is never easy to tell someone who should be so happy that their baby is dead.\n\nIzzie is getting tired of Lindsey's cheery probing so she volunteers to help Christina dig through poop. \n\nMeredith goes with Mark to see his patient Donna who is in to have her penis turned into a vagina. Meredith had to take a moment to get over the fact that Donna was a man. Then it became a question of saying he or she at that point. Donna's wife tells her to say she. This means Meredith has to spend a large part of the show reading up on penises.\n\nBack in the woods, the guys hike out to a camp sight and pitch tents. Joe and his boyfriend have such a large tent that the Chief asks if he could stay with them not knowing they were gay. George clues him in. Suddenly he is blathering about ""Man Love"" and ""Brokeback Mountain"" and his Gay cousin and how he is all okay with that. Burke broke in before he could further embarrass himself and took the guys fishing. Derek is alittle upset because he thought it would just be the two of them ""Mountain Men"". Burke concludes Derek does not have any guy friends and that is his problem. Meanwhile the Chief is complaining that the fish don't seem to be biting and Derek tell him that is because you are supposed to be silent when fishing. George is talking to Burke about Christina and Callie and how he is trying to commit to Callie te way Burke committed to Christine. He starts to notice that Burke is casting and reeling funny. Burke tells George that Christina and him are a team a machine that works as one. Burke excuses himself down the river a bit. \n\nBack at the Hospital it has been made clear to Christina by Bailey that she wants to know why Christina erased her off the board. If she doesn't come clean she will never see the inside of an OR again.\n\nMeanwhile Meredith has set down the rules for Mc Steamy, no flirting, no McSteamy looks, no talking about Derek. He broke all of those rules in about two seconds. His approach was that Derek was damaged. He damaged him, She needs to move on with him.\n\nAddison and Callie are having to deal with the woman who wants Addison to say it. She won't believe her baby is dead until Addison says it and when she does the lady cries hysterically. Unfortunately Addison still has to deliver the baby. The woman is having trouble wanting to push but she does and in the end Addison hand her the baby in a sheet to greive.\n\nBack to Donna, test show that she is rejecting her hormones and that has created breast cancer. Mark wants to cancel the surgery, stop the hormones and start treating the patient for cancer. Donna is told the hormone will only make the cancer return. Donna refuses the idea of going back to be Daniel. She wants the surgery and she wants to face the cancer as a woman. Her wife is not happy with this. She doesn't want to see D"

3050,8,"www.conradaskland.com/become_a_music_producer.html \n\nHere's what he said:\n\nTo become a music producer you have to PRODUCE MUSIC. Start right now. No excuses. Most people spend more time talking about it than doing it. Being a music producer is not glamorous most of the time. It's a lot of sacrifice and long hours. Be prepared to spend a lot of time alone.\n\nThe Golden Rule: Don't let people waste your time. There will be a LOT of people that will dangle carrots in front of you so they can take advantage of you. They can only take advantage of you if you let them. On the same token, when you're starting out don't play hardball with clients; take each and every job you can.\n\nMy rule for myself: Never work for free. Even if you only make $5, make sure it's not for free. Why?

3085,8,"Raised in Bethel Acres, OK, Wade Hayes grew up around country music. His father Don was a professional musician who played bars and honky tonks across Oklahoma. Through the influence of his father, he began playing music as a child. Initially, he played mandolin for a while, but he switched to guitar at the age of 11. Inspired by honky tonk, outlaw country, and bluegrass, Hayes developed a distinctive style at an early age. \nWhen Wade was a pre-teen, his father signed a contract with a Nashville-based independent record label and moved the family to the Music City. Within a year, the label had folded, leaving the Hayes family broke. They struggled back to Oklahoma, where Wade began playing guitar and singing backup in his father's band, Country Heritage. Following his graduation from high school, Wade went to three different colleges, but he decided to drop out of school to pursue music after seeing Ricky Skaggs on the 1991 Country Music Awards show. He moved to Nashville and beginning playing on demo tapes, all the while working on his own original material. Shortly after he settled down in Nashville, Hayes began writing songs with Chick Rains, who arranged an audition for the vocalist with record producer Don Cook (the Mavericks, Brooks & Dunn). Cook was impressed and began working with the singer, eventually getting him in contact with executives at Columbia Records. \n\nOld Enough to Know Better, Hayes' debut album, was released in 1995. The record was an immediate hit, with its title track becoming a number one single. The Academy of Country Music nominated him for Top New Male Vocalist of the Year for 1995. Hayes' second album, On a Good Night, was released in the summer of 1996. Although it wasn't as big a hit as his debut, it still sold respectably. \n\nHayes' third album, When the Wrong One Loves You Right, was released in early 1998 and Highways and Heartaches followed two years later. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide\n \nWritten by Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n \nI think he's still around, the search result page that I got this from mentioned a Wade Hayes divorce."

3116,8,"The Da Vinci Code is a mystery/detective novel by American author Dan Brown, published in 2003 by Doubleday Fiction. It is a worldwide bestseller with more than 60.5 million copies in print (as of May 2006) and has been translated into 44 languages. Combining the detective, thriller and conspiracy theory genres, the book is part two of a trilogy that started with Brown's 2000 novel Angels and Demons, which introduced the character Robert Langdon. In November 2004, Random House published a ""Special Illustrated Edition"", with 160 illustrations interspersed with the text.\n\nThe plot of the novel involves a conspiracy by the Catholic Church to cover up the ""true"" story of Jesus. The Vatican knows it is living a lie but does so to keep itself in power. The novel has helped generate popular interest in speculation concerning the Holy Grail legend and the role of Mary Magdalene in the history of Christianity. Fans have lauded the book as creative, action-packed and thought-provoking. Critics have attacked it as inaccurate, sacrilegious and decry the many negative implications about the Catholic Church and Opus Dei.\n\nDan Brown's novel was a smash hit in 2003, even rivaling the sales of the highly popular Harry Potter series. It spawned a number of offspring books and drew glowing reviews from the New York Times, the People Magazine and Washington Post . The novel has also inspired several tour groups like Da Vinci Code tours, and companies like Ravenchase Adventures to create Da Vinci code like races and adventures using codes, ciphers, actors and gadgets. It also re-ignited interest in the history of the Catholic Church. As well as re-invigorating interest in the church, The Da Vinci Code has also spawned numerous ""knockoffs"" (as they are referred to by Publishers Weekly) , or novels that have a striking resemblance to The Da Vinci Code, including Raymond Khoury's The Last Templar, and The Templar Legacy by Steve Berry.\n\nSony's Columbia Pictures has adapted the novel to film, with a screenplay written by Akiva Goldsman, and Academy Award winner Ron Howard directing. The film is set for release on May 19, 2006, and will star Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon, Audrey Tautou as Sophie Neveu, and Sir Ian McKellen as Leigh Teabing.\n\nPlot summary\nSpoiler warning: Plot and/or ending details follow.\n\nThe book concerns the attempts of Robert Langdon, Professor of Religious Symbology at Harvard University, to solve the murder of renowned curator Jacques SauniÃ¨re (see BÃ©renger SauniÃ¨re) of the Louvre Museum in Paris. The title of the novel refers, among other things, to the fact that SauniÃ¨re's body is found in the Denon Wing of the Louvre naked and posed like Leonardo da Vinci's famous drawing, the Vitruvian Man, with a cryptic message written beside his body and a Pentagram drawn on his stomach in his own blood. The interpretation of hidden messages inside Leonardo's famous works, including the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper, figure prominently in the solution to the mystery.\n\nThe main conflict in the novel revolves around the solution to two mysteries:\n\nâ¢What secret was SauniÃ¨re protecting that led to his murder? \n\nâ¢Who is the mastermind behind his murder? \n\nThe novel has several concurrent storylines that follow different characters. Eventually all the storylines are brought together and resolved with the denouement.\n\nThe unraveling of the mystery requires the solution to a series of brain-teasers, including anagrams and number puzzles. The solution itself is found to be intimately connected with the possible location of the Holy Grail and to a mysterious society called the Priory of Sion, as well as to the Knights Templar. The Catholic organization ""Opus Dei"" (a caricature of the real Opus Dei) also figures prominently in the plot.\n\nThe novel is the second book of a trilogy by Brown in which Robert Langdon is the main character. The previous book, A"

3136,8,"Gerald Levert, 40; raw and explosive R&B singer, son of O'Jays vocalist\nFrom Times Staff and Wire Reports\nNovember 11, 2006\n\n\n \nGerald Levert\n click to enlarge\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nGerald Levert, a fiery singer of passionate R&B love songs and son of O'Jays singer Eddie Levert, died Friday. He was 40.\n\nHis label, Atlantic Records, confirmed that Levert died at his home in Cleveland. The Detroit Free Press said the cause of death was a heart attack.\n\n""All of us at Atlantic are shocked and deeply saddened by his untimely death,"" a company statement read. ""He was one of the greatest voices of our time, who sang with unmatched soulfulness and power, as well as a tremendously gifted composer and an accomplished producer.""\n\n""It's very sad. He was an amazing talent, obviously,"" friend and fellow rhythm and blues singer Will Downing told the Associated Press. ""Gerald was a hard worker. He would go out there and do his thing, and be in places where the folks were. He would touch the people, and that's really what it's all about.""\n\nOver his two-decade music career, Levert sold millions of albums and had numerous R&B hits.\n\nLevert was born July 13, 1966, in Philadelphia and was raised in Cleveland. He first gained fame in 1986 as a member of the R&B trio LeVert, which also included his brother Sean and childhood friend Marc Gordon. They quickly racked up hits, including ""(Pop, Pop, Pop, Pop) Goes My Mind,"" ""Casanova"" and ""Baby I'm Ready.""\n\nBut Gerald Levert's voice â powerful and soulful, almost a carbon copy of his father's â was always the focal point, and in 1991, he made his solo debut with the album ""Private Line,"" which included a hit duet with his father, ""Baby Hold on to Me."" His father also recorded the successful album ""Father & Son.""\n\n""We wanted to express some of our feelings for each other,"" the younger Levert said of the father-son collaboration in a 1995 interview with The Times.\n\nEddie Levert said he cherished their work together.\n\n""I never talked much to my dad,"" Eddie said of his steelworker father in The Times interview. ""My dad was always working or he was coming home tiredâ¦.\n\n""Don't get me wrong â he took care of the family. But that's why I made it a point to have the kind of relationship that I have with my sons. I made it a point that I would know them and I would let them know me a lot more than I knew my father.""\n\nBut the elder Levert initially had concerns when his sons got involved in the music business. ""I didn't discourage them,"" he told a Times reporter in 1989, ""but I really wanted them to go to college, learn a craft, and then, if they wanted to do music and it happened for them, great, but they would already have a craft that would generate a living. But they didn't want to hear that; they wanted to be in show business.""\n\nGerald Levert was known for his sensual, romantic songs, but unlike Luther Vandross, whose voice and songs were more genteel, Levert's music was explosive and raw â his 2002 album was titled ""The G Spot.""\n\n""When we would do shows together, we would get on stage and battle for the hearts of women,"" Downing said. ""Every night, that was our thing.""\n\nAlthough Levert was successful as a solo singer, in 1997 he got into group mode again â joining with R&B singers Johnny Gill and Keith Sweat to form the supergroup LSG. The self-titled album sold more than two 2 million copies, and their hits included the sensual ""My Body.""\n\nLevert also worked with other artists as a songwriter and producer.\n\nHis most recent album was 2005's ""Voices.""\n\nLevert had four children."

3147,8,WHY are you asking/making this same statement AGAIN after five minutes???
3148,8,"""Aquarius people are like bubbles in the air- one minute here, the next minute-there""\nAquarius is the only sign that has no particular description, except for that they don't get attached to anything or anybody and many of them are eccentric. They're their own people, the world around them doesn't really exist to them.\nTons of Aquarians were unreal geniuses (Mozart to name one)and many of them are just outstanding people (our presidents: Lincoln and Washington). You're right, Aquarians are absolutely fascinating- I was in love with one for many, many years (it didn't work out- he is famous and gets anybody he wants, I was just a toy to him). They're extremely talented in many different fields, and most of the time their talent drives them insane, literally.\nAlso, since they do what they please and when they please, they tend to be misunderstood by the world which expects people to be ""this"" or ""that"" way. Aquarians are their own way, the way that only they understand.\n\nEDIT: I just realized that my previous statement was an oxymoron. I said that the Aquarian I was in love with ""treated me as his toy"". He didn't. I know he really loved me, in a way that only he knew...I always saw it in his eyes, in his smile...\n""It's not that I don't love you. \nI do.\nAnd I must let you go\nbefore you know\nhow much.""\nOh, what heartache did that man put me through...But you're right, even though I'm a Leo, I agree that Aquarians are THE BEST. If it wasn't for one, I would never know what true love is. They love you in such a strange way...If you ever loved an Aquarian, or if you were loved by one, the memory of it will stay with you for life. That's why they're the best. UNFORGETTABLE."

We're members and go several times a year.\n\nThe California Academy of Sciences is a great all around natural history museum.\n\nThe SF MoMA is a decent modern art museum.

I can't say that I would spend hours there, but it is really cool to see a scale model of the whole SF bay and delta area simulating the ebb and flow of the tides.\n\nFinally, in Old Town Sacramento, there is the California State Railroad Museum which is a great museum for kids and adults.

3200,9,"Depends on who is the male and who is the female. You see female Aries is like they wanna do everything they way. If they love someone they can became very obsessive and possessive. But overall they are not too bad to have as a girl. Where Aries men are a bit more difficult. They are stubborn and are use to do things their way. They also can became possessive in some way. Overall they like fun and run from fights and disagreements. This can be a problem in any relationship.\n\nGemini females are homely people, they are very keen on their home and like bringing friends over. In a relationship they are jealous and somethings suspicious of things that doesn't mean any thing. They are sometimes so busy that they forget to spent time with their partner. And boy can they talk a lot. Gemini males are calm and easy going, but take their partner very seriously up. They don't say what is the things that really bother them and keeps it all to themselves.\n\nSo Gemini and Aries can work but there are things they need to look out for that can mess up the relationship. For ex. If you know you are a jealous Gemini - work on expressing your feelings and handle a problem you have before you take things overboard."

3206,9,"Aye, honey I'm having the same issues as you (but in this case, I don't think he likes me.) Usually (from what my girl friends have told me), guys are very upfront with their feelings and they're obvious about it. He may pay more attention to you, be touchier with you, laugh more around you and look happy/act happy when you're around. Surprisingly, this boy might even tease you to an extreme point if he has feelings for you (it happened to me once) which is very 5th grade, but it still happens. You could, however, just go up and ask him if you want a direct answer :) because no matter what people tell you, there's usually no way to know unless he tells someone or you ask him yourself."

They either are like your stalker friend (count your blessings on finally losing that one) or they are simply horn-dogs expecting that you will give it up at the drop of a hat.  I have been single again for 15 years and think, at times, that it is just easier to be alone with my cats.  Good luck to you.  There really are some old-school females left out here."
3223,9,"Now that you're divorced, and probably alone, your mind is playing tricks on you. Remember how bad it REALLY was! Remember the times he said things that weren't true, or called you names? Get out of the house, and meet somebody new. That's the only way you're going to get over him for good. He threw you, and the kids, out of the house. He NEVER treated you good! Make yourself move on if you have to, but do move on! Good Luck!!"
3224,9,"It depends if your son wants you to go with him. If you are the type of parent who is also a close friend with your child, then there likely won't be any problem. But if you're just asking because you want to be sure of his well-being while he is there, and you want to be able to watch over him, then no, you shouldn't go with him. \n\nYou need to take into consideration the type of relationship the two of you share and if that will work in his favor while he is there or against it.\n\nIf your son wants someone to go with him because he has never gone before, maybe he should ask a friend to go, someone his age so he won't feel completely alone while he's there. Straight friends often go with their gay friends in order to be supportive and it would likely not be frowned on by the people in the club.\n\nThe best way to find decent places for him to go would be to contact people in the gay community and ask them. Try looking up a local PFLAG group or one of the associations linked with GLSEN."
3225,9,"NO! I have been in an interracial relationship for several years and honestly do not even think about his race because I love him. This questions has been asked many many times and if you will notice, the only people that respond no to this question are white boys. Not all white guys feel this way, but the ones that respond no just feel threatened and I think that's really lame. I think you should love everyone and if you feel in your heart that a relationship is right, race should not matter."
3226,9,Hell no!

3228,9,"Just ask her questions about herself (but try not to sound like you're a stalker), and throw in the odd compliment (but nothing stupidly cheesey)"
3229,9,"Nasty problem that you will not be able to solve. Your ex sound bitter and bound and determined to punish you for something or other. Unfortunately, all you can do is remain constant in your affection for them, and hopefully, with time, they will see things as they really are...no guarantees...they may or may not turn against you ... time will tell. But, no matter what you do, what you say, if it is negative towards their mother, they will swear their mother is right. IF, on the other hand, you are sympathetic towards the mother's plight, do not bad mouth her, and, in gereneral, behave nobly, your chances are slightly improved that they will come around. Been there. IT is a very sad thing when one parent uses children to ""get even"" with another...all concerned are badly damaged, including the offending parent...but that is of no consolation to you. You have my deepest sympathy in this...I have seen this happen time and time again. Such a waste, and seriously sad. You are in a loose-loose situation, short of gaining custody ... and that won't happen unless you can prove she is unfit as a parent. Good luck."

3235,9,"A conviction does not automatically curtail parental rights.\nYes, a father who is in jail or prison can petition the court for visits with his child (blood or adopted).\nIf the custodial parent or guardian is unwilling or unable to facilitate such visits, the court can appoint a third party to do so.\nIf the child is under a certain age, the courts may want an independant evaluation to determine whether such visits are in the best interest of the child and if the child over a certain age, the courts will interview the child and give weight to their wishes... not the final say, but their voice will be heard.\nThe exception is that if the conviction was for crimes against a child, the inmate may not have minors visit him in most cases.\n\nEven in prison, a parent is still a parent, with rights."

3237,9,"People accept 2 girls easier because it's apparently sexy...I think people get disgusted by men having intercourse together because they stick their doda's in their poopers....It's funny too because when I was a hetero-sexual, men loved the idea of sticking their doda's in my pooper(I didn't let them), but were all like *ewwwww when male to male pooper pumping was mentioned....I'm sure I am going to get a violation for my answer to this question...altho I don't think I said anything profane at all!!!!!!!!!"
3238,9,"Whatever you feel comfortable with.  I tried to call my inlaws mom/dad, but it didn't fit.  I didn't ""feel it"".  And I felt odd when my parents and his parents were at the same place and I'm calling my father in-law dad when my father was there.  I just phased it out and now I call them by their first names.  It's the same way with my hubby.  He calls my parents by their first names.  Although,when we give them gifts or cards it's addressed mom/dad from us."
3239,9,are you married? I would suggest you slowly and carefully pull yourself from his debts. Seperate everything before he drags you down to bankruptcy. Talk to Debt management company to get you guys back on track.

3241,9,"guys r really complicated ppl. they dont all react the same to everything. it could be that he is preocupied on something eles. a lot of guys will get something stuck in their mind and it might be there for the rest of the day. now if you hang out with him everyday usually, and he will ignore you one day and then the other, hes got a gf. or soething along the lines of that, or maybe somethings going on at home that he dosent wont you to know about. and it could be that he just needs his space.. or he likes you."

3245,9,"Well you're in a good position b/c most good relationships start with good friendship... but @ the same time, it might be hard for her to adjust to the fact that u really like her b/c she thinks of u more as a friend and she's probably never been in a situation like that. Just give it some time... if you two are really good friends then u dont have anything to worry about! =)"
3246,9,"First allow yourself to grieve and own up to what went wrong without blaming another person.  That is how we grow up.  Then start to dream again.  The past relationship wasn't right or else it would have worked out.  So, start dreaming about that perfect person.  What would they look like, how would they make you feel, what would you do together.  The more you can let go of the old and welcome the new the better.  Look at it as having a white canvas where you can begin to create once again.  Enjoy the process and do a lot of nice things for yourself that make you feel good.  Start looking for the joy in your life from other ways.  Good luck."
3247,9,"maybe he's afraid that if it doesn't work out,he will no longer be a family friend. Maybe he cherishes your friendship more than anything else,just talk to him and ask him what's going on."

3250,9,"well ""sex"" is one of the things that humans Need to do, whether it be with others or yourself."
3251,9,"I think it's okay if it's not a nightly routine, ask him if you can participate, you guys have been together for 9 yrs, so you have to do what you can to keep the sparks flying...handle it like adults...would you prefer he be out doing this or just ""talking"" about it?\nI know some women can't handle the thought of someone or something else turining our man on but you can be a part of it...makes your intimacy better too"

3260,9,"That my Friend Is called Love. When a guy is madly in love with you its so hard to break that connection.He would feel like at the bottom of the world if you leave him.\nThats how sometimes you feel.And that connection is Called\n\nLove.You must tell him nicely dont push him to hard,still be friends with him. \n\nThats the you find true love?\n\nwhats is true love?\n\n\nTrue love? or a lustful kind of love? There is a difference.\n\nTrue love? The world stops around you when you look into the eyes of the one you love. No one else, nothing else seems important, but the connection that is you share with this person. And you can feel it in thier eyes. As if when they stare back into yours, that they are saying without speaking, ""I adore you, respect you, desire you, admire you"". True love is when you connect on a level that makes you want to do everything you can to make that person happy, and that they do the same in return. It is a powerful feeling, when the world stops around the two of you. You will know it.\n\nLustful kind of love is much different. Its the feeling that omg I have to have that person, they are so very attractive, and that I think I am in love with them. Its a false true love. \n\nYou will feel love for him in time.\nThat love is connection.,YOu can tell him by passing him notes.or leaving him a message.! take it slowly my friend.do that if you are shy.talk to him ,call him,,,relate your feelings towards him.he will start to understand and like you.\n\nremember\n\nBeauty is in the eyes of the beholder"
3261,9,"You should just move on, while you are with him you might be missing out on the right man for you. It sounds like you and your boyfriend aren't really in the relationship anymore anyway, you're settling, you're just in it because it is comfortable."

3266,9,Woman... what did you do ?
3267,9,"I don't think 10-12 years is a big deal.  You can look just as good or better then the woman his age, plus your smarter and wiser!  After that I would say time takes a toll!  If it's not the physical appearance your worried about, but maturity, well maturity comes in all ages.  I've seen 20 year olds more mature then 30 year olds and so on....just enjoy what you got!  Hardest part is finding someone you connect with, and you already accomplished that!  ps.It's the perfect age difference for a great sex life-so I heard! LOL"

3271,9,"they are important in different aspects.  but think of it this way; if the girl really loves you, she will understand you need time to do your studies, but you two need to communicate.  after all, she will be grateful later on when you both have good jobs and can pay your bills! ;) good luck!"

Like her favorite candies, ect.\n\nOr why don't you write her a letter to tell her all of the reasons you love her. \n\nGood luck with your gift. But I think anything that comes from the heart and is creative will be a great gift!"

3278,9,"Do you mean to have a girlfriend who doesn't treat you like a piece of crap or, have a girlfriend because you feel like a crap without one. Anyways if you have a girlfriend that treats you like crap, find a new one. If you have no girlfriend be patient. You'll get one if you really want one. Your not a piece of crap. Lots of people have no girlfriend or boyfriend."
3279,9,"I'm sure he has told you he has a plan but think about this - HE is about to do something stupid. Now he wants YOU to do something stupid. So he must think you are stupid enough to do it!!!!! Even if him running away is for a good reason like he is getting beat at home, why the hell would you go! At 15 and 16 you both cant make enough money to support Sea Monkeys let alone yourselves. PLEASE DONT DO IT!!! He can stay at my house and you can visit until he can get on his feet but DONT you both become wasted youths."
3280,9,"Those kinds of guys are usually the dumbed-down jocks who tend to view life as a pie-eating contest, and view all women as nothing more than somekind of dessert. It's people like that who cause everyone else to be stereotyped, because all they are interested in is constantly working to outdo and outperform each other in every way they can, and prove they are somehow better or more macho or other really dumb and ridiculous bullSh like that."
3281,9,i prefer ok looking/good personality because looks eventually fade but personality is for life.and i'd want to be with someone who makes me happy when i'm around them.also lust only lasts for so long but love is forever.

Who would drive back and forth from home to the school to pick up clarinets and library books and permission forms?\nWHO I ask WHO?
3286,9,"If you think love is nothing but kiss and hugs, you haven't felt it yet. I mean no offense to you at all, but that's (at least what I believe) to be true. Love is as much an emotional thing as it is physical. When you find your true love, it's like your life is complete: you don't care if your job sucks, you have no  money, and you look like crap. Just knowing that someone loves you can make all the difference. It can be the best or the worst thing in the world, depending on if it lasts."
3287,9,"Honestly, she will not listen to you if you tell her she's going down. The only way she can see her mistake is by hitting bottom. If you truely care about her, you will stay her friend even though it will be hard for you to watch her fall apart. When she hits bottom she will need someone who cares about the real her, to help her get back on her feet. If she hits bottom and she is friendless she may never come back up. I hope you can be there for this poor girl. I hope for the best for you. I'm sorry about your situation. Good luck. :^)"
3288,9,"Do something for her that would truly surprise her (in a positive way). Cook her dinner. Make her a card. Buy her 2 dozen roses. Tell her on the big screen of a ballgame. Take her out for a nice dinner, get down on one knee, present her with some sort of jewelry, and tell her how marrying her was the best thing that ever happened to you, and so on. Just be creative. You can do it. You know you're wife the best. You know deep down what she would like. You've just got to sit down and really think. Good luck, Romeo!"
3289,9,"Me, you have to learn to love yourself before you will be able to love anybody else. It is in the text books."
3290,9,First of all don't jump him about it..just watch and learn. if you are really into him then you will be able to tell if something more than friendship is going on. Some guys and girls do have opposite sex very good friends they never do a thing with besides talk to..Don't get worried until hes caught in action. Then when you do catch him let him know you been watching for along time and you were hoping it hadn't turned out the way it did.  And if nothing ever happens between them besides friendship then you and your sweetie will be on cloud 9 with no problems between you.\nI have been married for 27 yrs to the same guy..believe me this tactic works.

3298,9,30 days... by then you've probably gone as far as you are going to go.... women start thinking of it as a relationship then... be nice the first couple weeks then get increasingly not nice... if your lucky she'll break up with you first.
3299,9,"Your boyfriend now is willing to raise it as his own, and the real father wants nothing to do with it among a litany of other problems, sounds like a pretty clear cut answer to me."
3300,9,"It's just like riding a bike. It'll come back to you.  Also, how can you be so sure that it was you who was doing anything wrong?  Sometimes people decide, for whatever reasons, they don't want to be in a relationship any longer or they fall out of love with the person.  Obviously your boyfriend just didn't want to be in a committed relationship.  Yes, it's hurtful to be dumped, especially by somebody you really love and who doesn't have the decency or the balls to sit down and really be honest about why he really left (because he wanted to be able to screw at will) and not leave you trying to figure out what you did wrong.\n\nForget his azz (literally and figuratively).  Pick yourself up, go out with friends, keep moving forward and one day you'll look up and he'll be a distant memory and you'll find someone new."
3301,9,"Not to discredit anyone, but luv_2sing06 is so wrong. Nowhere in the 10 commandments does it state ANYTHING about premarital sex.The closes it comes is ""Thou shall not commit adultery"". In fact, if it is so wrong in the eyes of God, why did Jesus hang out with prostitutes, thieves, killers, and tax collectors? In fact there is a story (John 4:4-26)in which a woman is talking to Jesus and she tells him that she is not married, and he replies that she has been married 5 times and is living with a guy. BUT NOT ONCE does he say anything about it being wrong. Also in John 8:1-11, Jesus says ""Let the one without sin cast the first stone.""\nNo sin is greater than another."
3302,9,Give her loads of compliments and take it slowly. Take your time over foreplay and give her lots of attention. Talk about things you enjoy and get her to show you how she pleasures herself. She is the best person to tell you what she enjoys so make talking about it fun and lighthearted and be open minded to her answers.
3303,9,You are correct.  They're both wrong.
3304,9,"Talk about it in a mature way. Be open, honest and direct. Tell him you need assurances your not some sort of sextoy or friend or whatever. This may freak him a little, but it's better than being in the state you are in. It is better to know that waste energy wondering and imagining.\n\nYou may be hurt with the direct approach, but it beats just blowing the whole thing without even knowing. It could be that this guy finds it hard to express his feelings (most men do), so just be gentle, be honest and be natural. \n\nIf he says no, then don't let it bother you, you are not the problem, it's him. This world is huge and full of hundreds of thousands of singles all looking for someone to enjoy spending time with. Enjoy life, don't waste it on worry x"
3305,9,"I can tell you from experience that you can find great women via Craigslist.\n\nI have met more attractive women via my ads there.\n\nI can't speak on Match.com\n\nBest of luck,\nJeffrey"

3307,9,"you should be more specific about what you want to know.\nsex is fun, and good excercise, and an all around good thing! the first time can hurt, usually does, it can also be scarry! its something new for you to experience. just relax and let whatever happens happen. its a natural thing, and is not something to be ashamed of.\nyou might try looking it up in the dictionary or googling it!as to get more information.\ncongrats on your marriage!"
3308,9,"I am in your position. I think that its not fair that the popular kids always have the best clothes. I have learned tho that you can buy some of the same clothes for 1/2 the price. You shouldnt be jealous, but it is okay if you are, its natural. Just go to stores that yu can afford and buy cute clothes and things and they might get jealous of you because you have something they want.  Dont be jealous, just be thankful for what you have."
3309,9,talk to her about that\nand u too take in ur mind her personality she dont do it only with u but also she do with all her friends\nshe is bush girl so she may dont have free time to contact u \ntry to talk to her about things she make u sad from
3310,9,"If ignoring doesn't work, or he creeps you out too much:\nTell him FIRMLY that if he continues to follow you around, that you will begin contacting authorities (police, the principal, etcetera- I don't know your situation). \n\nI once had a problem with someone like that, and he called my bluff. I actually called the nonemergency police line. To hear me talking with someone in Authority scared him and he never bothered me again.\n\nCarry your cell phone with you at all times and have alternate routes/emergency plans in your head.\n\nBe safe."
3311,9,Perhaps he was taking u seriously from the beginning and u were not.  tell him that u were not serious and considered him just a friend...and never indended to convey the signals as he received or perceived.......i think he might understand
3312,9,"Lol this is difucult situation.Maybe that girl is not grown up enough to be with you or with someone normal who is not tolerating that ""b i t c h"" kinda behaviour.\nU should try someone else or if u inlove with her very much try to make thingz like she does.Go and hang with other girls and maybe she will think twice for the thingz she does!\nIf u cannot do that then try to talk with her and force her to explain to you what is happening between both of you!Tell her to be honest and not to lie"
3313,9,"If I was in your shoes, I'd be proud to have a boyfriend who never hurt me, and was always there for me. Relationships on the movies are not realistic, they are made the way they are to make us feel excited so we get a thrill from watching it, so relationships are portrayed in a way that isn't real. They are movies for a reason - entertainment and not real life."
3314,9,You can find someone else who is a little different from him. Not a rebound. Before you know it your caught up with someone who you never thought you would be with and liking it.
3315,9,Well if you know the person is going to be back in 10 days just stay busy until the time is up.  If nothing else the time apart from the person will make you realize how much you enjoy your relationship with them =)
3316,9,
3317,9,"If he was telling you how much he liked you and then so quickly showed up dating another girl it is very likely that he was telling her the same things he was telling you.  Move on honey, he's not worth it.  How do you move on?  You stay busy by spending time with the people that are worth it.  Hang out with your friends and family and ignore him.  You're too good for him."
3318,9,"Go for it, make another date, sounds fun"
3319,9,"Yes, then you can 'undo' things that were stupid. But if you did that, you would never learn from your mistakes."
3320,9,"Yes it is, especially when the person smiles at you or he or she gets ""that look"" in their eyes.  \n\nIt can also be a sign of love at first sight if you believe in that."
3321,9,"My sources say yes. ;D\n\n\nMagic 8 Ball aside, you've really done all you can do besides pray and hope. Of course, you could tell her how you feel and ask her out. Try something simple and honest, like: ""I am very interested in you and I think we have things in common. Wanna go get a burger after school?""\n\nBest of luck with making a new connection!\n~Tia~"
3322,9,"just tell him that you really liked him and that you would want to keep in touch with him.  is he coming back?  just wait and keep in touch with him.  as time goes by your hearts will began to grow fonder of one another and if it is meant to be it will happen.  as for now if you just want to get some lovin, I would say don't do that because it will ruin everything even the friendship.  just call him once a week or bi-weekly when he leaves and make sure the conversations are good.  Also every now and then just say that you met this guy and you went to a movie or something to make him a little jealous but when you do this make sure he knows that you two are just friends but don't over do the friend part.  you know what to do.  or that's an idea take him to a dinner and a movie for a going away gift and just when he thinks he's going to get some be strong and leave!!!!"
3323,9,"Take her somewhere fun.  Minature golfing, a zoo, an amusement park...some thing you can both enjoy and be yourselves at.  On the first date you want to get to know the person, not sleep with them right off the bat.  Well, okay, maybe you want to sleep with them right off the bat...but getting to know the person in a relaxing atmosphere is sometimes easier than some stuffy restaurant."
3324,9,Stop trying so hard and be yourself.  That should get you noticed...right now they probably think your Bi-Polar
3325,9,Having their own moon might affect it...
3326,9,"He's not ready to turn his life over to God yet...don't push him, he will know when the time is right for him."
3327,9,"This isn't an unusual problem.  Why don't you masturbate in front of him.  1- This shows him what to do/how you like it. 2- It also gets you and him a bit hotter.  I'd also suggest taking as much time as you need to get you ready, taking advantage of all of your sensitive parts.  Let him work on you a bit, then do it yourself a bit.  I'm sure if you keep working at it you will come."
3328,9,Why young guy? Ive found men tend to be more caring as they GROW up!
3329,9,"The string of ***** is pussey\n\nPussy is both a vulgar word referring to the vulva and vagina, and an affectionate term for a ""cat"". Thus it can be used as a double entendre. It can also be a derogatory term implying cowardice.\n\nThe origins of the word are unknown. The Oxford English Dictionary (OED) explains that the word ""puss"" is common to several Teutonic languages, usually as a call name for the cat â not a synonym for ""cat"", as it is in English. Both the OED and Webster's Third International Dictionary point out similarities with the Old Norse, pÅ«ss (pocket); the Low German, pÅ«se (vulva); and the Old English, pusa (bag), etc.; the medieval French word pucelle referred to a young adolescent girl or a virgin [1], although this comes from a slang term for virginity puce (flea) rather than referring to cats. In the 17th century, the term was also used to refer to women in general.\n\nThe word in the former sense normally refers almost exclusively to the aforementioned portions of the female anatomy. It was not included in George Carlin's list of seven dirty words, as it can be used in the sense of kitty, and George Carlin's list was remarking upon words that can never be said on television. Most dictionaries mark the form referring to a vulva as ""vulgar"" or ""offensive"" and its use is frowned upon in polite company.\n\nThe word pussy can also be used in a derogatory sense to refer to a male who is not considered sufficiently masculine (see Gender role). When used in this sense, it carries the implication of being easily fatigued, weak or cowardly. This meaning for the word may arise as a shortened form of 'pusillanimous'.\n\nMen dominated by women (particularly their partners or spouses and at one time referred to as 'Hen-pecked') can be referred to as pussy-whipped (or simply whipped in slightly more polite society or media).\n\nAccording to the Oxford English Dictionary, puss was used as a ""call-name"" for cats in both German and English, but pussy was used in English more as a synonym for ""cat."" In addition to cats, the word was also used for rabbits and hares as well as a humorous name for tigers. In the 19th century, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, the meaning was extended ""in childish speech, applied to anything soft and furry"", as in pussy willow. In thieves' slang, it meant ""fur coat"".\n\nTo pussyfoot around the question or point means to be evasive, cautious, or conceal one's opinions. The reference is to the careful, soft tread of the cat and has no vulgar implications.\n\nI hope i have explained as much as u want.\nenjoy hope this helps u out with ure confusion."

3331,9,Enough money to support my kids and never have to worry about makin it from paycheck to paycheck anymore!!
3332,9,"That question kinda has a tricky answer. We develope relationships all the time that don't involve sex. People love their parents, I know I love my friends. However, in a relationship it's more complicated than that. \n\nIn order to oblidge natural urges my first inclination is to say yes, in that one isn't really complete in a romantic relationship until sex. There are several biochemical and social reasons for this. It's hard to feel romantic love for someone without feeling that you know them completely. If two people are avoiding sex with one another they are not opening up to each other and cannot ""know"" their partner's, in that sence. As far as natural hormones are concerned, the bonding chemical of the brian called oxytocin is signifigantly more present in males at the time of orgasim. Women's levels of oxytocin are naturaly much higher than males, on a day-to-day basis. They feel bonded with people much more easily than men. With this in mind one could argue that a woman might be able to love without sex much more easily than a man.\n\nHowever, in a time when ""no sex until marrage"" was very prevelant people still fell in love. I think that we as a race and as a culture are always looking for ultimate companionship in another person. We will always find that special bond no matter what aspects of it you add or remove, including sex."
3333,9,"To me, love is a figment of the imagination and not real at all...People are just hopeful that they will find someone to fill the void in their lives, nothing more.  When they do meet someone, they think that it is love."

3335,9,"Just a simple ""Thank you."""
3336,9,"I've been there and tried to do that. Except it was ex bf. I only realized that giving him time was the right thing. He came back to me with his own self. Taking him back is the only thing that bothers me now. But that's not the point. Knowing what you want from your relationship is! You, both, have to be open like a book. If both of you feel like you want a relationship than accept her when she comes back to you. But still give her time. (If she doesn't, than that only means that she's not right for you.) Usually it's much easier to get along if you are understanding your needs and wants. But if she is depressed, like she is saying, that must be the relationship she had at the moment when she was with you. Though finding another guy - is not the answer either. I say get yourself busy, and let her live. If she wants you, she will come back, and will appriciate you for being there."
3337,9,"she will smile at everything you say, play with her hair or touch her neck around that area, keep touching you, like on the arm or something. keep giving you puppy dog eyes etc.\n\nxXx"
3338,9,u have to respect the mother but you have to let her know how  you feel about her boy and don't lie moms know but remember you are with the son not the mother and you don't have to go around her
3339,9,It just depends on how much you are willing to take from him.If you can't take anymore then leave.He obviously isnt going to quit doing whatever he keeps doing. Its been 5 times. Maybe you should seperate for awhile. Just to get away from the crap. I
3340,9,5 fingers across the face ...
3341,9,He likes you. Just play along and enjoy it. He will surely ask you out himself.
3342,9,"i dont know why u have done that, (put your pics up) i think you seem to be very incecure it is your weight?? any girl who would fall in love with you is a question we cant answer or cant predict, she will come alone one day. u seem really sweet dont let her walk all over u when the time comes. good luck sweetie chin up hun xxxx"
3343,9,"Girls go for the boys/ guys with the looks, or the ones who are popular or whatever.  Start looking deeper.  usually the best one to get involved with are the quiet/ shy ones that most of the girls ignore.  Just a suggestion..  Looks diminish with time.  The heart stays true."
3344,9,"ex man to the next man, even if it happens to be a best friend, we can all be friends is my motto!"
3345,9,"Give him the space.\n\nTell him that you'll both go your separate ways for a year, then meet up after that year and see how things are.\n\nIf he still says he needs space, then tell him OK, this time for 6 months.\n\nIf after this, he still isn't sure, then it wasn't ment to be.\n\nIt will be hard for the first few months, but it is well worth it as you will both grow because of the experience.\n\nGo see the world in this time, do YOUR thing and don't worry about him.  Get out and enjoy life.\n\nIt will do you both good.  And you never know, could both end up getting married to each other because of the break. :)"
3346,9,"You need to talk to your wife about this and see what you can do to get her on your level! I know excercise always seems to bring on more energy, especially sexual energy! Maybe she could try this! Keep things exciting and stirred up to keep her interested!"

3351,9,"I found the easiest way to tell someone, at least for me, was to just write a note. Writing your feelings down allows you to express exactly what you feel, but are afraid to in person. It worked quite a few times for me."
3352,9,"These know it alls know nothing I'll give it to ya st8t! The clitoris is one of the most sensitive places a woman has, it can NOT be pierced without the piercer losing his testicles, teeth, etc. There is something called the Clitoral Hood it is the skin where in the clit is found. This can safely be pierced, by someone who knows what they're doing! The feeling? I ain't got 1 so I can only tell you what I've heard. Yes it feels good! It feels good at first! After a while the clit becomes numb! That's from 3 different girls! Good luck Sweety!\n\nhttp://www.total-knowledge.com/~willyblues/"
3353,9,Love is a choice to commit to do what is best for another.  Sex without love is a choice to do what feels right for you. Love+Sex=:)

3355,9,girl ur still very young there are plenty of us men out thier and u probably havent ran into the right one or the right one might just be in ur face all the time and u might ot notice it. the last girl i dated is when i was about 11 and she moved away. after that i couldnt find no one. no girls seemed intrested in me. but one day i found out that this girl liked me and she was one of my best friends and i liked her so much. and now we have been together 4 an year and im 16 now. it took me 4 years to find out that i liked her and she liked me. so just hold on and youll find u someone.
3356,9,"Yes, of course it does. Breeding within a limited population always increases the incidence of recessive gene expression. Interestingly, a lot of these societies practice consanguineous marriage, which further amplifies the risk."

3358,9,"What is your rush?\nHave a serious talk with him.  Ask him what his intensions are.  Ask him if he knows why he hasn't asked already.\nIf he is serious, he should at least talk with you.\nIf he stringing you along, better to find out now than later.\nSame if he has serious doubts."
3359,9,If he is a smoker- a nice zippos lighter.  Get him something he will USE every day so that when he uses it he will automatically think of u!  Or a cd for his car- someone you know he really likes.  Or make him a cd of mixed songs that u chose for him.  Make him coupons on red construction paper if u r at the sexual stage with him.  My hubby loves getting his coupons every Xmas!  lol  Use your imagination on those!  Good luck to you!
3360,9,"If you're only on level 1, you can only answer 20 questions a day.\n\nKeep answering and you will graduate another level and be able to answer more.\n\nThe ""suspension"" is only until the next day."

3362,9,"If he is selling  the house you share, is pushing you away ( emotionally ) & still wants sex  - yes, he is using you . Im sorry you miss him & believe me, I more than know what your saying, but sweetie - you cant make him care for you if he no longer does in that way.  You deserve to be more than anyones booty call. There are lots of guys out there who will treat you well & love you . Good luck ! :-)"
3363,9,Call me and I'll show you where it is.
3364,9,just don't or you'll regret it later!
3365,9,"I don't care what anyone says, you can't go from being friends to lovers.  Well, it's not entirely impossible, but let me know the next time win the lottery... twice."

3368,9,tough one. Best advice I have seen on the board.  So far  have his Dr adjust the meds its not working like it should.
3369,9,Hard drugs.  Being with a guy.  Some other really kinky stuff.\n\nGood for you Miss dumping him.
3370,9,"You really want to know?\n\nTreat him like you did when you were trying to get him to ask you to marry him.\nOnly compliment.\nOnly praise.\nOnly .... laugh at the bad jokes. When he does anything right praise him. Compliment how he looks, acts, touches, kisses. \nMake sure you do everything you did to get his attention. Did you wear things when you where with him that would draw his attention?\nDid you do stupid things to make him laugh? Did you act childish? \n\nHave you told him lately to grow up. Have you told him that he did something wrong, why did he not do something else. Oh wait those are things that he never heard from you before you were married.\n\nI have a lot of other stuff that I've seen happen after the ring went on if you need more examples.\nI also have a TON of stuff that happy couples do."
3371,9,
3372,9,First things first make sure he has a DNA test to rule out being the daddy to the baby.If you really love him then tell him.Maybe you guys could just start over and begin a new life together.I would make sure that he understands that you do not want him seeing other women if you do decide to get back together.If he is the daddy to the baby do you think you could handle all the drama it will bring to you.Just think about what you need and want in this relationship.Good luck with everything dear.
3373,9,"Like everyone else has said so far, he is probably flirting with you. Even though staring for more than 10 seconds is creepy. But he may just be a nerdy shy guy that has a crush on you. If you like him back, just ask him why didn't he say anything to you. If you like his response (if he gives you one) ask him to lunch tomorrow. \nIf you don't like him back tell him to stop bothering you because his is creeping you out."
3374,9,"if you have to ask that question, then maybe you don't feel love for him the way you say you do. you would just know."
3375,9,"It sounds to me that he has some serious immaturity issues.  My advice is to ignore him completely.  Don't glance in his direction and if you hear rumors about yourself, just say, ""it's really sad that he has to pump himself up by spreading nasty rumors."""
3376,9,"If you are really afraid of him, get his IP address from the emails he sent you (make sure full headers are on, open one of his messages, his IP address should be under ""X-Originating-IP"" in the headers. Copy down this number and send it to the police (and while you're at it, put the number in the text box at http://www.hostip.info and it will tell you what city he lives in (not too accurate, but the police can do better))."
3377,9,"Well, that IS a coincidence!  I was there in church, too, and believe me, that voice was much too authoritative and resonant to have been that of Mr. Munson.  The Lord has spoken--and He should know more than Todd's friends!  I envision a long and lasting relationship between you and Todd.  Will you do me a favor, if it's not asking too much?  Can you name your first girl child after me--call her Chain Mistress.  It's a devout and holy name, a variation of Charity.  Thanks!"
3378,9,i would definantly want him to make the 1st move
3379,9,"Because women think if she sleeps with him he'll stay around, and men think if he buys her things she'll keep having sex with him."
3380,9,"ME,ME,ME,ME !!! I like suckin' on cute lil' toes"
3381,9,"""reunited"""
3382,9,I would give him some time alone to figure out what he truly wants.  He cannot tell you he KNOWS he loves you and in the same breath say that he still wants to think about his feelings for his ex.  Give him some space and if he truly loves you and ya'll are meant to be then he will come back.
3383,9,to me: gender is enough to give a date a try
3384,9,this would be a case of two wrongs not making a right...no point  crying over trash... when trash is best left at the curb....no point cheating in return  that spites no one but yourself .. #1 he would be gone .... courtesy of my foot up his A$$... #2 revenge is a dish best eaten cold....
3385,9,"A true friend will never turn their back on you.  A true friend will give advice as well as ask for it.  They will listen to your problems, and ask you to listen to theirs.  They have you in mind, not just themselves.  ""Friends"" cannot do all the things that I've explained above."
3386,9,There is no real answer to this question but what I have learned of what love is to me and that is the word LOVE itself holds the answer.......\n\n(L)isten: and Validate them by hearing and empathizing.\n(O)verlook: their minor character flaws as they will overlook yours.\n(V)alue: who they are and what they mean to you.\n(E)xpress: how you love them not just with words but with actions.
3387,9,"Yes, you go to the recycle bin on your phone, select the message and select undelete.  Then you can see all those msgs that torment you so."
3388,9,start by not following him everywhere.if they ask you before goin out if you wanna tag along just say no thanks and don't call to check in on him
3389,9,don't change be yourself! all these other girls are a real turn off.\n\nlove kby xx\n\n.
3390,9,you should tell him maybe he feels the same way too. I told my guy friend i liked him and now i am marreid with twins on the way. you never know unless you tell him who knows maybe he is your destiny and keeping this from him can change your faith.
3391,9,"I think if you just say you are sorry and that you love her...maybe take her out to a movie.  That could work.  Just let her know you love her and care about her, make sure she knows it."
3392,9,Well who does he go home with?  Looks like you get the last laugh.
3393,9,"If u really like this guy well, just one morning get dress up do your hair or thins and when you see him take a deep breath. Ask him out on a date or do u want to go out with u\n\nGood luck.."
3394,9,"one day grasshopper  you will realize that people have all kinds of problems getting revenge on a person who you chose as your partner does not satisfy.  look into yourself for what is your problem for choosing poorly, not your partners."
3395,9,"ohh im really sorry.  thats horrible.  if you dont get sympathy from your crush, that person must be a cold-hearted bitch.  but trying to get a date is a little much.  trying to milk your injury for all you got huh?"
3396,9,Girls going to single sex schools on the whole do better than girls who go to mixed schools. \n\nPart of the reason is thought to be the distraction caused by boys and then boyfriends.\n\nI would surmise that boyfriends take part of a girls attention away from the task at hand. \n\nSo in most cases they would be detrimental.\n\nHowever it depends on the boy and the girl and I would suppose that some other areas of learning IE about the opposite sex is useful in the long term.
3397,9,"What you describe is one passage ""faith without works is dead"" . . . which basically mean . . . ""do it yourself, because I am not going to do anything for you, and if you fail . . . don't blame yourself . . . . blame me and say it is God's Will"""
3398,9,"check up to doctor, may be the baby was sick!!!"
3399,9,watch it together
3400,9,"you're the fool for asking this question. Grow up! you know you can't even fool your mommy. and go to school, where boys and girls are in the same class and find out who the real fool is."
3401,9,"oh please! dont even listen to them. just tell, \n\n""dad,mom, i am the one getting married here.i am going to live with this guy for the rest of my life and if i do not have feelings for him, the marriage will never last. i have someone i love and my heart is with him and i am getting married to him. i would really appreciate it if i could get ur blessings, but if not, i will still marry him""\n\nsimple and short! gurl, they wont live with you and this ""certain"" guy. if they reallly like him, guess wat?they can get married to him. or have him live with them. sheesh!\n\ndo wat ur heart tells u anyway!"
3402,9,Whats wrong with telling him how you really feel about him?
3403,9,As long as it takes.  We'll let you know when we're happy.
3404,9,tell her to be careful and be alert\ntell her the people she must avoid\nlook after her\n\nbut if anything bad happens....its up to you to throw those punches and make him feel the floor and make him taste his own blood...lol....just kidding....but im gonna do it if anything bad happens if i were you
3405,9,"From a girlfriend...it was (her face turning red and filled with disbelief) ""...you are The One!"" ...\n\n...lol, true though!"
3406,9,if you feel like you need to talk to him go for it. If hes seeing a girl she might not like it though.
3407,9,tell me your age first .then i tell you how.
3408,9,because of the fact that you were so close to your Grandpa and you miss him...he was a big part of your life apparently...some one you could go to and talk about anything...grief knows no time limits...you will cry for him now and probably the rest of your life...its human nature...thats all
3409,9,
3410,9,"Rule Number 1 of friendship is that you NEVER date an ex of theirs--especially if it's your best friend.  That's almost like incest or something.  Even if you asked her and she agreed with it; somewhere within herself it would hurt her tremendously.  She just wouldn't want you to know that.\n\nRule Number 2 is that you learned a lot about the guy by the way he treated your best friend.  If he was a jerk to her, he'll repeat actions with you.  I personally think he just wants to ruin your friendship and make your best friend suffer by watching the two of you together.\n\nJust don't do it.  There are TOO MANY people out there to narrow things down to a best friend's jerk of an exboyfriend.  That's immediately set up for failure in two aspects."
3411,9,The stupidest question i hav seen.......anyways 2 pts
3412,9,Thank you for sharing.  And the question is?
3413,9,Wisconsin. Women are traditionally the more affectionate of the sexes so it's more acceptable to see women being touchy/feely with each other than for men to be that way. I am 100% heterosexual and I've found it exciting to watch 2 women all over each other and I've even participated fully clothed in front of my husband and found it a turn on to see him so turned on. Sometimes it's fun for the shock effect on bystanders too.
3414,9,"Once every 2 weeks is not all that much.  You are just normal, don't let your religion make you feel guilty.  (I will bet you 99.9% of the people in your religion do it and the .1% that don't have a medical problem)  Keep your soft porn and keep studying.  The men that are banging every skirt that come their way are the sick ones."
3415,9,Please don't do the typical guy thing and feed your ego with the other 3.  If you like the one you are with tell them you are unavailable and want to see we things go with the current person you are seeing.\n\nYou seem like a good guy for being concerned and asking.  Don't hurt her or you may lose a good thing.\n\nGood Luck
3416,9,its the same thing as why are older sisters so mean to their younger brothers. Its just their way of being protective and joking around.
3417,9,"whereever you are married there is a record. try contacting the courthouse or church  you were married, there will or should be a copy in the nearest city or town hall.\n\nVin"
3418,9,way 2 much
3419,9,"Fantasizing about the same-sex for women is quite common, and a ""true lesbian"" would be the easiest to experiment with.  I still love my ex-husband very much, but I am supposed to be with a woman."
3420,9,A simple no would be okay
3421,9,pshhhh.
3422,9,If you are a kid i would make little coupons that say \nOne day of no cleaning\nOne Breakfast in Bed \nOne angel Day\nOne Shopping day alone\nMake best mom award and a card she'll love it try it
3423,9,boo boo kitty f*ck\nhaha
3424,9,unfortunately you cannot make someone be more romantic. people are who they are and you must either love them for who they are or go your own way. if you feel like you need someone to change in order to suit your needs you are only fooling yourself because true love only exists when everything suits eachothers wants and needs without making major changes in personalities...i will agree that a relationship of any kind takes effort and sacrifice but usually someone is either affectionately romantic or they aren't and if you try to change them it may make them feel very uncomfortable or insecure.
3425,9,No but you should share them with each other.  its not fair for you to be the only one having all of the good fun.  Besides that way you dont have to split your time between the two and you can all have more time together.
3426,9,"If you cannot even talk to her, and you think she's the girl of your dreams, you have very few options.\n\nBest bet, somewhere safe, where she can escape easily, ask for a 15 minute coffee date sorta thing.  Then you seem ""normal"" and ""harmless"", working on the story/stalking thing simultaneously.  If at work, just bring her coffee, figure out what she drinks... get that with frothed milk (consider lactose intolerance...) on top.  Then try and talk to her while she struggles with a hot foamy beverage.... put's them off gaurd, I use this all the time.\n\nAbsolutely NO gushing poems, singing on the balcony crap... save that for once you actually KNOW, mess it up, and need her back."
3427,9,"without trust you have nothing.  So figure it out sweety.  It is not worth it to argue with someone.  Relationships are based on happiness.  Yes, there will be fights but not all the time.  I think it is more that you are not compatible."
3428,9,he is hot!!
3429,9,like *****
3430,9,"That's a hard one. When I try to be friendly, some take it the wrong way, and vice versa. The best way is to ask yourself 4 questions:\n1) How long have you known him?\n2) Have you interacted before? If so, in a relationship?\n3) Consider his past experiences\n4) Think from his point of view: Should I flirt with this girl I just met or be friendly? Or vice versa.\n\nHope this helps!"
3431,9,You can watch for signs of attention past a friendship. If that person acts shy or uncomfortable around you all of the sudden it could mean they are self-concience and is wondering what you think...or you just did something wrong.
3432,9,"No its not!!! Because the bottom line that once you marry the sex life becomes less and less. It may not be right away that this happens but its true it does happen. When you are thinking of marriage you should make sure that this person is the one who you want to spend the rest of your life with. Marriage is about uniting as ONE!Its my opinion that communication would be the most important thing in a marriage up under have Jesus at the roots of the marriage! Sex does play a role in a marriage because  two people who are married feel the most connected when they are making love as the should but its not the most important thing. Marriage includes making decisions together, compassion, understanding, just letting the other one know that you are there for them no matter what, friendship.  So have fun with your SEX but remember marriage is more that just SEX if you marry for this reason then you are going to end up unhappy and wanting out! Truth of the matter, things change so will the sex life.Good Luck to you!"
3433,9,A natural odor - delicious!
3434,9,"Older people just get to be more intense, more of what they already are.  Teenagers are just trying to become more like adults.  Sometimes the two don't mix.\n\nIt would help if you could sit quietly and try to figure out what you are doing that is pushing her buttons and then try to work on that.  Did you leave a mess?  Is she exhausted after a full day's work, having to return home to a house full of people that she has to clean and cook for?  Is anyone helping her out or is she just old and grumpy?  If she left you how would you take care of yourself?  Would you feel bad?\nIf that doesn't work for you, try a sense of humor.  You might not be able to say what you re really thinking to her because she might not understand you, but you can enjoy the comedy of the situation."
3435,9,I dont think its has to doing anything with marriage. She probably was  not being pleased in more ways than one. Believe it or not women also get frustrated if their significant other canât not please them in bed or even getting any at all. If the boyfriend is not showing any interested or giving any attention  its easy for a women to look for comfort   in another man. Donât feel to bad for the boyfriend it might have just driving his girl to friends arms.
3436,9,"We always expect people to be as perfect as we think we are.  I have similar issues with my husband.\n\nWe need to remind ourselves of our inadequacies and be real.  Learn to ""pick your battles"".  Life is really too short and your marriage is too important to battle over things like this.  Let stuff go and see what happens.  Watch the world not end.  I promise you that it will help you relax and it will make things more peaceful.\n\nEnjoy the time you have home with your husband and allow him to be able to enjoy it too! :)"
3437,9,In the morning go up to him and say hi and then start talking about what he like. And then keep going on then what u do to other guys to get there # do that to him too.
3438,9,Love makes life worthwhile.\nWe love who we're meant to love.\nWe love when we're meant to.\nWe love unconditionally without hesitation. We love with all our hearts.\n\nP.S. That entails being careful and very wise.
3439,9,"i would say it is ok, but just ask your friend first.  other wise she will most likly get mad.  thats what i would do."
3440,9,Just tell her that this person was wrong about the way he lived and she will know everything she want to know when she is ready. Tell her there is time for everything and this person history will not change if she just wait a few more years. she is just a kid don't worry she will find something else to occupy her mind soon.

3443,9,"Usually when you look you could never find that special someone in a million years. It is when you just go about everyday life, being yourself, enjoying the life you have when the best thing you can imagine rolls around to turn your world into awe. Life is a mystery...but do know if you sit by and let it pas you are not in it to enjoy life. LL."
3444,9,"Most rebound relationships don't last very long.  The reason for that is because in most cases, the guy still has feelings for the girl he just broke up with.  And vice versa, of course.  It's great to have a shoulder to cry on, someone who really cares, but when you've just left someone, especially if you have/had feelings for them, it takes a while before you can really move on.  I learned that the hard way.  Twice.  :)"
3445,9,both low self esteem and low self worth.\n\nalso add to that no self respect.
3446,9,What the hell are you talking about?
3447,9,Plain and simple.  It is called the Pituitary.  A gland iny our brain the produces sex hormones.  A built in function in our brain that drives us towards sex.  Sex promotes procreation.  \n\nOriginal man was a basic as animal. The goal is reproduction.  The strong surive and produce as many as yourself to ensure a part of you lives on.  Our bodies also developed a great sensation towards sex. A greater reinforcer to have sex and reproduce.  Would you want to have sex or reporoduce if it didn't feel good?
3448,9,"I don't have lips, can't talk."
3449,9,"Don't live in a fantasy world. It doesn't exist. Either there is or there is not. Yes or no. There is no in between. So pick up your feet and find someone that is real. If you think things are going to change, it won't. Unless the person knows. Tell him/her and if it doesn't happen now. It will happen to you someday."
3450,9,"he shouldnt have to.  Watching porn is nothing to get upset about, who is he sleeping with every night?  those girls arent real and most guys know that.  Stop making him feel guilty!"
3451,9,not me. sorry
3452,9,You can love two people at the same time loving each for different reasons but you can not be inlove with two people.
3453,9,It can be as little as 5 or 10k to as mich as 100k+...
3454,9,"I really don't think it's an issue of what's wrong or right or if you ""sin"" that's a bad thing.  The point of all the preaching is about what is best for you spiritually.  The people that do the preaching have turned it into what's bad and good and make it a morality issue.  \n\nReally, what you need to think about is what does sex do to you.  Promiscuous sex solely for seeking pleasure can run the risk of addiction, disease, etc., and isn't good for the soul or heart.  In a karmic sense, sex in marriage as an expression of love is less of an attachment - meaning one is less likely to get caught up in it and with love and responsibility of the marriage it kind of nullifies the lust from sex.\n\nSo the question is what is your spiritual quest or goal?  Nothing?  Just getting to heaven?  Or do you want to become a saint?  If you just want to get to heaven then I don't think sex in marriage or with commitment and love will keep you from that.  If you're looking to be a saint then letting go of desires and being celibate is probably necessary."
3455,9,"Yes, I think the love can be there.  However love will disintegrate extremely fast when there is not trust.  I was in a relationship like that and even though my feelings for her were strong, I could never get oer the trust issue.  If you cant trust the person you love, who can you trust?"
3456,9,
3457,9,Yes
3458,9,"If your friend doesn't know that you and your boyfriend are an item, then she is doing nothing wrong.  You need to tell her because if she thinks she has a chance with him and she doesn't she runs the risk of getting hurt."
3459,9,"When looks you in the eye when he speaks to you and his words are only meant for you.  I love my husband for all the little things he does for me and it makes me want him all of the time.  He is fantastic to me!  I think it is super sexy when he takes control and makes he stop[ what I am doing just so he can give me a kiss, or tell him how cute I am or just to look at me!  Being wanted by someone makes them sexy!!!!"
3460,9,"Co-incidence dcides whom U meet in liife\nYour heart decides whom U want to stay in life\nBut DESTINY decides who will stay in your life\n\nLove is for Life, Life is not for Love.\nLove may fail in Life, but Life should not fail in Love\nSo dont spoil Life in Love, but dont forget Love is Life."
3461,9,Don't give her any attention unless she is calm whilst heaping praise on her twin for being calm.\nDon't try to barter or reason with her because that gives her the impression that preschool is something to worry about.\n\nBe calm and cheerful yourself on the way to preschool so that she arrives in a good mood.\n\nGood luck!
3462,9,"Tell him the truth.  Just say ""hey, I think you're a great guy, but I really don't think you're the right person for me.  I want you to be happy, and I want to be happy. I don't think I'm happy right now; but that is not your fault.  Like I said, you're a great person, but just not the great person I want to be with."""
3463,9,
3464,9,"I don't see how that's possible. Either question. Two of our children wanted to get their noses pierced and we told them no, they could do what they wanted when they moved out. A few years later both had reached legal age and moved out, now their 30 & 33 and neither has pierced their noses. It was just a passing thing I guess. Your parents for now are your boss and you should listen to them and respect their choices for you so long as you know it's nothing to harm you."
3465,9,"the situation is unlikely to improve, i'm sorry to say, so you have to decide how much you can put up with"
3466,9,
3467,9,females period.
3468,9,"First of all, don't delete your number. Be strong, let this weak punk know that you are not gonna be pushed around. Send him a text back...Stop sending me messages! Don't do it gently...end it like you need to end it. Be firm. See he is messing it up for everybody...so we need to get knee deep in his azz. And if that doesn't work....send me an email, and I will get him to stop myself. We need people working together to stop ignorant azz people. Yeah show the police the messages, there are laws now, and then call your provider and block that fool."
3469,9,"i'm 29 and i can so relate to you.  i mean dating itself is so confusing and once you are dating someone it is confusing to know how often you should date them, before it becomes exclusive.  i am going to keep coming back to your question to see the answers.  sorry i couldn't be more help."
3470,9,"""no"" plain and simple"
3471,9,
3472,9,"i know the obvious answer that many are probably thinking, if he loves you then you will be fine. in fact the is not at true as most people would like to think. Your not just talking about sex you're talking about intamcy as well. WHen you do have sex for the first time i won't lie it hurts. The reason it will hurt for the most part is because oyu will be so nervous about be nakeed and having sex that all of your muscles will be conctracting. Which will then in turn make it that more difficult for your finance to enter. just remeber that when  you have sex with him that he loves oyu he won't be juding you in anyway he will be overwhelmed with the fact that he is with you for the rest of his life that he will just be in awe. also keep in mind that the first time is going to be a little bumpy because you two don't know each others movements yets. so yees it will be awkward. having sex for the first time is different for eeveryone. but it may be easier, since it seems to me that he has had sex before, if he were to get on top. so that way you won't feeel that yopu have to do everything. Something that might make it easier is buy some kind of lubercation it makes it easier to get sttarted. with the lubercation you put it on him to make it more arousing for him and this will give you and oppurtunity to see, and feel what your husband feels like. make it fun for yourself. while you are doing that for him he could be doing something for you. either kissing your neck messaging your inner thighs. if you have a little for play it might take away some of the tension. It is most definetly going to be hard for you to be doing all of this. but just remeber that it will get easier. don't forget that he's not the only one that is there for fun. soemthing that might also arouse him and you as well is take is hands and put them on various parts of you and then you return the favor while he carressing you you do the same. moving on to the sex part of it. pull him towaards you so that he knows to get on top. then opoen your legs so that it is comfortable to you and he can get his whole body in. if you don't feel comfortable adjust and then proceed. when he starts to insert in to you MAKE SURE HE GOES SLOWLY. if anything starts to hurt tell him adn he should either stop or pull out. the key is to communicate. IT will be uncomfortable the first couple of times that you do it. but the lubercation should help out to some degree. After he has entered all the way, now is the time when you should be more relaxed. Now the hardest paart is over. While haveing sex make suree at all times that you are comfortable if your not then sex just won't be the same later. if your lower back hurts put a pillow under neith your back and continue. if you don't know how to move your body then have him move your body so that you both will enjoy it. and if you feel comfortable enough you amy want to get on top. If you do get on to, then just bend your knees so that they are by his hips, and sit directly over top of his penis. oncew he is back inside then move back towards is knees slightly and begin to move. if you don't know how take is haveds and put them on your hips and let him know that he needs to help. once he gets you going you can do it on your own. Of course this is all just a suggestion and you should do what feels right to you, i hope that i could help you CONGRADULATIONS and good luck. just remember RELAX."
3473,9,yes they do what you have done is become the teacher and they want to learn everything you have to teach...
3474,9,"Yes Hunni its normal....just because we are women doesnt mean that we dont have sensual dreams! :) As far as all the ex's go, they are probably attracted to her because she is putting out an air about her, that she is comfortable with you...that can be very attrractive to men.\nDont spend all your time worring about loosing her, enjoy her whilst you have her. There are no guarantees in life!"
3475,9,IN VERY STATE IT'S ILLEGAL AS HELL. YOUR KIDS MAY GET ALOT OF BAD GENES.
3476,9,"For the most part it is the maturity level. We want to be able to relate on the same things. Older men are also established, worldly, experienced, and aren't out to play games. They know what they want and life is less of a struggle. Women find these things very attractive & interesting. They also have tradional qualities like pulling out a woman's chair, opening the car door, etc. We appreciate those things that are often overlooked by ""young guys"".  They invest more time in the relationship, take the time to listen, really care.  It's not all about the next party or who can make their car go faster.  They're all about what's really important."
3477,9,Try to become friends with him.
3478,9,"If you love your mother more than your wife, then you're not a very good husband.   End of discussion."
3479,9,You know the girl? is she your friend or no? Either way it may have been in bad taste but be warned if he left that girl as quick as he did for you-he would more likely drop you as quick as a bad habit for someone he may think is hotter than you. I think that's the best reason it's not a good thing.
3480,9,Look in phone book or go to www.forrent.com
3481,9,
3482,9,"Hey I like you! ^_^ ..lol..seriously though, good for you it's really nice to know that there are men like you out there. \n\nMy husband WAS selfish-I am at the point where I am just like ""Come on work with me here"" it takes it's toll on a person when your lover thinks of himself before he does you all the time. And you keep telling yourself he'll come around, you only have Faith to keep you from drowning really...It hurts to be treated second all the time. \n\nNow he's changing and I can finally breathe a lil more....I think I will have to get use to being TRULY happy in this relationship of ours and believing that things are different between us... it takes two right? =) \n\nHey thanks for giving me a chance to share my thoughts slash vent....keep shinning and never give up! Best wishes to you and yours!"
3483,9,i have the same problem...i really like this kid but i don't know how to talk to him....i've tried hanging out with some of his friends who are also my friends and he comes up to his friends and starts talking to them and i'll just keep on talking to them...it's worked for me a few times...who knows...it might work for you too!!! tell me about the results!
3484,9,if it's two consenting adults
3485,9,"This happens a lot to some people.  I am a Christian and I know that saints go through to improve their character and make them more like the person God intends them to be.  It is hard every time.  The one thing that helps me is prayer.  Just talk to God and let Him know you love Him and trust Him.  Even when you see no way out, believe that it all has a purpose, even when you can not see an expected end.  I have faith that He will see me through and that He will never take me further than I can travel.  He is with you.  Know that sometimes we are shaken up fro all routine so that we are forced to go in another direction.  the pain of the experience helps us remember the experience and gain from the lesson.  If we make it throug to the other side, we have the victory and God has the glory.  Most of the time it does not make sense to us.  That is because we know what we want and sameness is comforting.  When the sameness is no longer good for us or is keep us from achieving the next level, only a complete shaking of our foundation gets us moving.  I will pray for your experience and that you will come out as pure gold.  It is the fire that refines us.  I am having a refining period myself right now and just knowing that we are going through at the same time provides comfort and reminds me to have faith and never give up.  A quitter never wins.  Stay in the race and press forward."
3486,9,"If you try to dig it further, you will obviously find a lot of proof to believe that she was completely distracted from your love relationship. She was just trying to keep you as a back up. I can say that because, from my experience, I know that these things happen when it doesn't even matter for her if you stay with her or not. You can be sure of one thing that she is one of the worst girls in the world. So, please try to control yourself and forget her bit by bit.\n\nYou have done the perfect thing. Just think of it! If someone has feelings for you, she will obviously try to make you happy and if you do not like something, she will try not to do so. But things are totally reversed here. So, you can be sure that she does not love you anymore. And you also should not be with her anymore.\n\nBest of luck!"
3487,9,"no..but judging from what i've heard personally about your relationship...you deserve a lot better, ben. *hug* a LOT better. besides look at ya...heck, darn, man...get out there! but wait for the right one to get serious with."
3488,9,"yeah, what else are we gonna do, tell them how much we care about them and talk about emotions?  gimme a break.  it's easier to toss them a beer and call them a douchebag."
3489,9,"The only way that you are going to get to know him is if you talk to him.  Start by saying hi in the hallways.  If a friend of yours knows a friend of his, go over in a group and talk (that may make it easier).  By finding common ground (like tv shows, sports, etc.), talking will be easier.  Once you start talking to him, look for flirtatious signals.  Or, he may ask you out.  But, don't rush things, you are only in the 5th grade.  You may just want to be friends and hang out."
3490,9,"Of course he won't find anyone like her ,it would take alot to beat that money grabber ,you only have to check her past history expect she decided that he didn't have enough in the bank ,so watch out all you billionaire single men in the states ,i reckon she could head your way next"
3491,9,"Hell to NO!!! its just this simple bad character no matter how you put it. And if you're going to cheat you're going to cheat no matter what. But the question is how long will it be before they decide to cheat?? And people think that they really love the person that they're in a relationship with, but yet and still they decide to cheat and also lack of will power, they're a lot of reasons why people cheat. Now I do believe that if you really love someone that no one can seduce you into cheating with them no matter what."
3492,9,He doesn't he's making you appreciate yourself and what's around you before you can appreciate someone else. Call it training if you will.
3493,9,dan T Here a big news for you!...\nhttp://www.osoq.com/funstuff/extra/extra01.asp?strName=dan_T
3494,9,"love is somethin that comes from your heart.it is more of acceptance of the person no matter who she/he is.it is self-sacrifice,enduring and understanding. of course love and romance are different coz romance may or may not involve love.romance is when you and your partner have mutual understanding, compatible in many ways but does not necessarily mean that you love each other. its maybe like you are together because you like each other."
3495,9,i have definitaly been here before\nsome how you could wright him a note\nbut just remeber that it is easier to write down things in a note\nbut it has more meaning to say it to there face\nand if  you know he likes you back\ngirl go for it you have friends to help you along if he breaks your heart and if he does\npound him into chalk dust!
3496,9,"Well, It seems he is with her for benefits when you both have problems . He goes to her. It sounds little funny in the picture . unless if it was his sister or Aunt house to crashed in. Then u are fine but a woman with a married man staying at her house. It seems lot of benefits for him to get away from you.  I think u better get straighten out with ur marriage before it becomes uglier! So, be sure not to be a blind wife to let him be free from you.  U are stil his wife and u have EVERY right to know whats going on with ur HUSBAND. Remember the VOWS!"
3497,9,"Keep reassuring him, smack him on the ass every now and then, tell him how great he looks in that shirt-load him up with kisses......men are such babies at times, how ever it is not out of the ordinary for men to want the affection, like us women do!!  Think about it, how great do you feel when your man comes home from work and says 'hey baby you look great today'...well it is the same for them, just make sure it isn't in front of his friends, then it might not be so much fun for him!!! Good Luck!! :)"
3498,9,"Being a lesbian is about being sexually attracted to women, not just hanging around them."
3499,9,"I know what it feels to lose a beloved one.  My little brother died at age 6, in June 2001, and I still cry out for him, pray to him, but also smile for I know he is now in a better place, just like your son.  They're probably very good friends up there.  \n\nThink of Spring.  Spring is the first season of the year, the begining of new things, the birth of many living things.  Look at the mountains how green they look, the flowers how beautiful they are, the butterfly that just came out of the cub.  Later in the year it dies, but it is born again.  \n\nJust because your son is no longer with you, he is still in your heart.  Remember how he used to smile when you would tickle him?  Or when you would take him out for a walk, and he'd be smiling, looking around, runing?  Remember those happy moments with him and smile.  \n\nYour son lives in you.  He will always be with you, wherever you go. Look up at the sky at night, find the shiniest star, your son is watching you from above.  A bird that lands on your trees, and singing, looking at you...your son is there.  \n\nI pray for you, for strenght, courage, happyness, comfort, and blessings from high above.  Bless your heart!"
3500,9,"Sad. \nI am a father with custody of my now 20 year old daughter. It is very sad. If it doesn't work out, you will greive the end of the relationship.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to rest knowing you did everything you could to keep the relationship. I would make one last case with her. Try to convince her to stay with you, but if and probably when she rejects it, move on. \n\nDo your best to get a non-contested divorce. Know this, you will only retain custody of your son if she allows it. Courts give the children to the mother if they just look like they want it. So if she agrees, keep your son with you, if not, let her have him and fight for the best visitation you can get, Joint custody, if you can get it.\n\nDo some work on healing yourself and do what you can to get yourself back to happy with yourself. People make mistakes, big mistakes but it doesn't make them failures. Don't expect to re-establish a close relationship until you have gotten yourself off the rebound and back to a normal life.\n\nGood Luck and Sorry to hear about your loss."

3502,9,Birds and bees? There are birds and bees? What do birds and bees do together?
3503,9,"We like honesty, but you don't have to be so blunt about it. If she asks if she looks fat in a dress, just simply tell her that she's looked better in others."
3504,9,"<Shows my hand to you>\n\nOk guess you cant see.. hmmmm.. \n\n.:Fishie:.\n\nP.S: No hard feelings pls, just trying to be funny."
3505,9,"The only thing i have to say is don't forget,move on, you can do hobbies and stuff. That could help you!"
3506,9,personality alllll the way.
3507,9,"unless the guy is an idiot it would have been awsome to have been in love with the first one and stayed with that one for life,but it just doesnt ssem like many of us are lucky enough to actually be with that right person on the first encounter."
3508,9,"same prob a while ago to my friend, she made a move on his friend, the friend rejected her but the rumors of her liking her friend almost completely went away."
3509,9,"I got the same relationship, but I won't go, because I behave on myself. But depends on you girl, isn't that really think so fast? And to look for some more time please!!"
3510,9,"no I don't believe there is...Welcome to America , the land of the free, the brave, and the divorced....unfortunately it's common here."
3511,9,"some times the best thing to do is just let her talk to whoever she feels comfortable talking to.  after she talks to her stepmom do her problems seem to be taken care of, or are they made worse?  maybe that should be your focus.  if she seems calmer after talking to her ex-stepmom why is there a problem.  if she seems worse after talking to her then maybe there is a problem.  your daughter is probably reaching out for someone who she thinks understands her and her situation in life.  maybe you should look at this woman as someone who could mentor your daughter instead of seeing her only as your ex husbands ex wife!!  all in all if it is good for your daughter then let it be."
3512,9,"First of all you cant make anyone love you, it has to come natural, and if you havent even talked to her yet , i would say , you really need to make a move, show her you like her try talking to her and see where it goes from there."
3513,9,It's only wrong if you've led them to believe you are being exclusive with them.
3514,9,
3515,9,Tell him to STAY out the next time he leaves...  that way you can have a more stable life for yourself & your kids.
3516,9,"Yep, free sex, no contract.  Sounds like he's got it made in the shade."
3517,9,"Ask why they think this is the case.  Don't be defensive about the statement.  Look at examples of your behavior that are presented to you objectively. Then tell your spouse/friend that anything is possible, and you will look for more info on this condition to educate yourself and them."
3518,9,None that I know.
3519,9,You mum is right
3520,9,Is it coryshawn?
3521,9,"You are too young to be ""finding friends"" on Yahoo.  Honey, there are so many psychos out there just looking for a young thing like you to take advantage of.  Talk to your friends at school and find out if they use Yahoo and start there.  I've been online for 10 years.  And if you look at my profile, you will see that I only have about 10.  Be careful who you chat with on here.  It could be VERY dangerous."
3522,9,she misses you and still has feelings for you. the fact that she continues to try and contact you even though you have been ignoring her attempts says she cares a lot more than you may know. all signs are pionting to the fact that she is probably sick of transition boy and wants to rekindle some sort of relationship with you. good luck.
3523,9,"All I can say is, leave that chick alone. That's not good at all, no matter what may be going on.\n\nMaybe her parents did have dinner with her, earlier. And maybe she went back and met up with him. Who knows? I hesitate to call her parents liars, but I've known parents who would lie for their children.\n\nEither way, bounce."

3525,9,Sounds like you got it down. Ditch the insecure tramps. There's a reason they're insecure and flip a sh.it every time you look at someone else - They're lookin' too. She just better be at least half as good as me when I catch my ol' man lookin ;)
3526,9,Well just ask him the same question you asked all of us how you know if someone likes you and then pay close atention to those things
3527,9,"true love encourages you to gain more and more money and also feel relax and 100 million dollars gives you more options to be among people and find your true love.it's hard to answer and also it depends on how strong this ""true love ""is.weaker or stonger than 100 million dollars.it depends in how romantic you are and how deep this love is and how your feelings are engaged or how much yourinrerested in money"
3528,9,both does matter wat..s thin s a stick but s long s a ruler...do u think da gal will enjoy...s thick s two banana but s short s an eraser...can u feel anything...lol...
3529,9,"The only thing you can do is remember those you have lost, but don't dwell on them. We carry a piece of spirit from everyone we will ever know and everyone we meet will carry a piece of our spirit. It is what provides a sense of immortality as we pass from the physical world we continue on in the hearts and minds of those we leave behind. \n\nIf you imagine your lost loved ones as being in heaven/hell than they are truely lost to you for you have chosen to forget who they are and assume they are somewhere far from you. If you think of only the good/bad things they have done than you cling to an illusion and ignore the truth of who they are. You must remember not only the things you liked about them, but the things you hated about them too. By sharing memories you add to the spirit of your friend for all that knew them, for each piece you all possess provides a better picture of who your friend truely was.\n\nContinue to live your life, and when you come across something that reminds you of your friend then think of them, remember those events of the past and let the spirit of your friend live again in your heart and mind. Instead of feeling sad, think about what they might say, for the moment you remember them they are there with you once again in your life."
3530,9,Yes. Very much so.
3531,9,"I think a letter expressing your feeling or treasured moments with her, or is your any kinf of pot, a poem could work as well\n\nGo to the dollar store, buy a nice picture frame and display the letter...add one single rose to that. (if you could afford it),,,,\n\nThat would be the best and most personal gift any woman can receive....something from the heart, and not store bought."
3532,9,"go to the gym\ncall your girlfriends up and do a day of beauty (pedi/mani, hair, facials, etc)\nspring clean\njust relax and be by yourself and do all the things you like to do for yourself"
3533,9,"It was hard to see but you seem handsome, and you should smile"
3534,9,"Every man feels the same at some point of time.well maybe your luck is to be blamed,but we usually are the reason for getting treated wonderfully or horribly!Keep in control, love them,be truthful.. that should(& would) help!"
3535,9,Ouch! \n\nI think that since you have already made a final settlement that she would not be allowed to come back at you for any more money. Also if her name is no longer on the mortgage documents then she should have no claim on the property. \n\nI would definately check with your solicitor before selling the house - after all if all it means is waiting a couple of months for the divorce to be final before selling and therefore not having to share the payment for the house it would be better.
3536,9,"I have learned straight forward honesty is the best thing in a situation such as this. That way there won't be any misconceptions in what you are telling her. It may shock or even hurt her feelings, but if you don't care to be friends let her know. Good luck.\n\nEagleman"
3537,9,
3538,9,"Yes. The length of your relationship is not the basis to get married or not.\n\nBoth of you have be SURE you want to marry each other. You marry because you LOVE each other so much and you want to spend the rest of your lives together. You need to be matured enough to understand and deal with the problems and consequences you'll have to face when you get married. You need to be physically, mentally, emotionally and financially ready about it. Make sure that you are ready to give up something (clubbing, you'll have less time with your friends, etc.) for your marriage.\n\nDon't rush, ok? Enjoy being young. You can still do and enjoy so many things. But marrying is not yet one of them. ^_^"
3539,9,"That is a hard situation. I guess it really depends on what he did and how bad it hurt you and made you lose trust in him. If he loves you and cares for you then he will have to work to get your trust back. There really is no time limit on these things, the trust will slowly come back if he proves himself to be trustworthy. It might help to talk to him about it."
3540,9,"Ah, Shallow Hal? That movie cracked me up! It's kind of sad that you can't seem to see the person who may be inside of their fat bodies. Depending on how old you are it could be baby fat, sometimes girls do not shed their baby fat until jr. high or high school! Maybe you should look for slender women at the health clubs. Or at the local public pools, they will be the ones swimming the laps. Yes, I think fast food is one of the BIG problems with young people and their weight this time (this is not a gender specific problem either!)...\n\nGirls/Women have to deal with different hormones and things like periods and bloating once a month. Most girls have a curious love of chocolate, and if you find a woman who has PMS, chocolate may save your life one day!\n\nPerhaps it's a lack of motivation to lose the weight or it could be that it's genetic, maybe you could take one of these hefty hefty hefty gals and turn them into the wimpy wimpy wimpy of your dreams? \n\nGood luck, nobody is perfect. It could be that although you are slender, and in good shape...you may not have enough other qualities to be able to get the slender babes to want you. Quite often if a woman looks real hot, she KNOWS it!  But go for it, nothing beats a try but a failure. Summer is coming, so the pools and the beaches should be good hunting ground for the women who have the body to show off their bikinis.  Have fun!\nruthie~"

3545,9,If the relationship is shaky why is he proposing?  Have you asked him this question?\n\nHave you asked him if he feels the relationship isn't as great as it could be?\n\nAll relationships go thru ups-and-downs but it sounds as if yours is aimed downward and sinking fast.  If you really feel that you don't want to remain in the relationship you should leave.  But it must be your decision.\n\nNo one can say 'go' or 'stay' because no one is in the relationship and viewing everything from your POV.  You have to do what you want to do on your terms.  It sounds as if (in your mind) you've already kissed the relationship goodbye...now all you need to do is actually take the physical steps and walk away.

In fact, don't even think about your grades at all. Just do your homework, and study for your tests and that whole grade problem should just disappear."

3549,9,"Honey, I have been there! I have so been there! (I suppose I still am there, as the wounds have not fully healed.) But I will tell you this, it is going to hurt like hell for a while, and I can tell you plainly that it is one of the most painful experiences a person can endure, because there is nothing worse than being betrayed by someone you love.  When I found out the awful truth, (and like you, I think I knew all along, but just ignored my instinct for the same reason you did) it turned my whole world upside down. I didn't eat for over a week, I lost interest in everything that once held so much joy for me, I was sinking fast and afraid I would never emerge from the despair.  But I can make a solemn promise to you that you will. I did. That's not to say the pain is gone, it's not to say I don't have ups and downs, don't occasionally just want to slip back into what was familiar and comfortable... But the truth of the matter is this, what I once thought was familiar was not, and he was in fact a stranger.  He has since begged for a second chance, and it is something I considered, but I'm just not sure I can give my heart back to someone who was so reckless with it in the first place.  Of course, people screw up and make mistakes, but when it comes to this kind of thing, I just know it will take so long to heal the hurts and it is something that will always be there, even if dealt with.  For your own sanity, work on forgiving him and letting go, because the pain will consume you. I'm not saying forgive him for HIS sake, but forgive him for yours. I'm still not there yet, but I'll keep trying.  What disturbs me is that your man was lying about more than one woman, which makes me think he is a serial philanderer. I wish I could give you some stronger advice, but for me the wounds are pretty raw, so I'm still trying to heal myself. All I know is that there is truth to the old adage, what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger. The best thing I can say is to take it day by day, I know the pain is tremendous, and you must think it is the only thing in the world that matters right now. When I first split from my boyfriend of seven years, I would hear these tragedies happening on the news, and I'd be thinking, ""what do they know about suffering? I know suffering!"" Then I'd think, ""Man, I wish I was on the bus that plunged into the canal..."" But slowly, I emerged from that dark place and life held joy once more. It will for you too. You will get through it.  Contact me at my yahoo address if you'd like to talk more."
3550,9,"You may never get the 'flame' back, but you can definitely stoke the embers and have a nice hot bed of coals!!  Plan surprises... meals in your bedroom spread out on the bed, with foods that lend themselves to play ; pineapple, grapes, honey, whipped cream, chocolate sauce, etc...  or try dating again. If you have kids, shuffle them off to a neighbor or relative for the weekend,  and just have fun together. Play tourists and see your own town like you don't live there. Go out to eat at a restaurant you've never been to before. See a show, or just take a nice, slow walk together. BE together like you used to be when you didn't have kids or a busy life. Try some new lingerie. Make him a basket with new stuff  for the two of you to try together, like warming gels for massages, and toys to try if you are into that. Make a game with your egg timer and some homemade cards; have six small piles of homemade cards that have things on them such as ""massage your partners back for 3 minutes"" and may go up to any position or act you like. Put the easier, lighter stuff into pile one, and go up to pile six, which will have your ""hottest"" stuff in it. Roll one dice, and whatever number it lands on, choose a card from that pile and do what it says. Then it's the other persons turn.  The only rule is you CAN'T make love! ( We always end up making love anyway, coz you just can't stand it, but it's fun trying!)    The point is to spend quality time together, and just have fun again!  The rest should all fall right into place!  Good luck!"

3575,9,"It all boils down to values & upbringing, isn't it? Your guy has a point which is the conventional approach that kids should look up to parents NOT as equals which explains why he finds it disrespectful that your son calls you by your first name.\nHowever, as I understand it, you're a rather liberal person hence your ID ""hippie mama,"" lol find it's not so much of a big deal. Though as long as your son is being respectful in other aspects in life i.e. he doesn't speak rudely of you in the presence of others or is well-behaved, it shouldn't be a problem. It's your call."
3576,9,i know it is hard to let someone go  when your in love but sometimes its the best thing to do. She knows that you in love with her and she thinks your never going anywhere so she is playing with your emotions. as long as you let her walk over you she is going to do if she love you so much and want to marry you  she would do anything in her power to make your realtionship work. but believe me she going do what she wants to . you need to show her your strong and you deserve someone that will respect and love not some on thats wants her cake and eat it to. believe she come around and when she does it will be to late because you moved  on the old saying goes you never miss a good thing untill its gone. i hope you are strong enough to let her go . i wish you the  best of luck keep me updated
3577,9,"shes victimizing you... she shouldnt be putting you in the middle of her problems and that makes her a poor excuse for a friend... what im trying to say is, do you want to be the one who conspires and allows her to cheat on her husband or do god knows what? Think of the husbands feelings in this situation... While you dont want to be the cause of them splitting up you have to know that if you told you wouldnt and couldnt be held responsible, your friend decided to do this to her husband and she should have to face the reprocussions. Do you care about this girl enough to actually lie on her behalf over something that could split them apart? I think its the husbands right to know whats going on, in my case I think I would not tell the husband where she is but if you know his friends or family tip one of them off and possibly they will tell them... its complicated but you cant be incriminated because you didnt tell her husband where she was, you tipped someone off and they told, but i think its the right thing to do in letting the husband know in one form or another that his wife is lying to him and may be doing more... hes a human being and has feelings to, and she is digging her own grave... It was wrong of her to ask for you to lie about her because she is putting you in the middle of their problems and asking you to conceal the fact that she is destroying her marriage. If I was you I would tip someone off and then let them tell the husband,  either way theres nothing you can do to come out of the situation without getting hurt because if the husband figures out that you have been lying to him about something that is ruining his marriage then  hes going to hold you partially responsible... and think would you want to be in that sort of situation as well. would you want your husband to secretely be doing god knows what and you to be completely oblivious to it and how would you feel about it if he asked a friend to lie to you for him? you have to put yourself in the victims shoes, and honestly you both are the victim to her lying ways"

The following year I had a neat freak again for a roommate and she would just tell me ""could you please pick that up today or your turn to do the dishes"".  All I needed was a little reminder once in a while and that works.  You did move in with them however it is your place as well and they need to respect that.  Just say something even in a joking manner they will get it.  Good luck and don't just do it for them they will never learn."
3586,9,i dont mean to be mean but you just have to deal with it.  some things you could try are:\n\n1) ignore him - if he feels ignored he may just give up\n2) question everything he says - the guy who likes me says stuff to me like 'youre my hero' and i just say 'why?' That really annoys him.\n3) if he tries to start a conversation give him flat answers.(eg. yes or no)

It develops from the same cells which, in a female foetus, develop into the G-spot, we think.\n\nBeing open to this does *not* make a man gay, and not all gay men enjoy anal play or penetration. There are many nerve endings around the anus and, if people are open-minded enough to try, then they can find play there very enjoyable.\n\nIf you want to indulge him, try playing after he's showered, with plenty of lube, gentle at first, and see if you get into it. Some women do. The good sex sites (Good Vibrations, Scarlet Letters and Toys in Babeland for example) will have information if you want it."
3598,9,No one can control their feelings. If you love someone it kinda comes naturally. When you and that person stop talking it takes a while to really get over that person especially if you were really in love. Even  though some might say that they don't love someone  any more 9 times out of 10 it is not true. We have to let nature take its course.

3624,10,"The Great War had positive and negative affects.\n\nIt opened new avenues of trade with our allies who needed American weapons and munitions, not to mention other goods needed for the war.  Consider the need for uniforms, boots, tents, and so forth.  Further consider that as demand for these items went up, the probability of business success in the industries which supplied them went up.  In other words, there was profit in supplying war materials, so factories were built and people employed.  Aviation advanced in technology and popularity as more people on both sides of the war took to the skies for their countries.\n\nOn the down side, millions of people were killed in combat.  The Influenza Epidemic of 1918-1919 killed millions more as the flu strain was communicated all over the world by soldiers returning home from the trenches.  The soldiers who survived came home to find the jobs they had left were taken by others, so unemployment was a problem.  Some veterans even set up squatters' camps in Washington, DC to protest conditions.\n\nSure, the Roaring Twenties can trace some cultural elements to the reaction of a generation having lost its innocence in combat, but I think you are looking for more specific information.\n\nI hope this gives you a good start.  This was all done from memory, so you still have some research to do.  Good Luck!"

3651,10,"Define ""Allow"" :) I would guess that they aren't openly allowing it, more turning a blind eye to it. The problem comes from the fact that both of the industries you mention rely on illegal immigrants for labour, since most Americans don't want the jobs themselves (since the pay is so low and/or the conditions are so bad) Therefore if the legislature starts cracking down on those companies, they could literrally destroy them. Even if they don't levy the enormous fines that would probably be legally required for the companies' infractions, the companies would still be in a position where they simply couldn't afford to hire the staff they needed to keep going.

3653,10,"A UN report condemns 'torture' at the detention camp. But, like other revelations in the 'war on terror', the reaction is to deplore the publicity and ignore the brutality. In the US, meanwhile, the report barely registered with a media industry still obsessed with Dick Cheney's shooting accident. It got even less attention than the disclosure, earlier last week, of new photographs of the 2003 abuse in Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq which were more shocking than any seen before. Although the evidence reinforced the belief in much of the world that both Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo are symptoms of American disregard for any rules in the ""war on terror"", none of this was reflected in major US newspapers, which put reports on the new photographs on inside pages, and did not print any of them. The Bush administration was able to brush off both the Iraq and the Guantanamo affairs. \n\nhttp://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article13597.htm"

Repeating the same unfounded spew, does not make it truth. No matter how many times we can show these uber-libs the factual circumstances and documentation behind things, they keep going right down the same path. Unbleievable.\n\nBush, like every other person or president, makes decisions that are not necessarily in line with the popular consensus. He also makes mistakes. He's also in the last term of a presidency that is continually under attack from the left wing of the Democratic party and the media. With that kind of continual influence, popularity numbers will fall.\n\nThe weird thing is that just a bit ago it was in the 60's (negative reaction), yet with this apparent mistake with the control of American ports, the pols show a slight increase in popularity. It goes to show, yet again, that these small polls are not exactly what we would call accurate or something to be taken as an absolute truth.\n\nWhile I am sure he will continue to be very unpopular with the uber-libs, and will have a good amount of opposition with many other Dems, I don't really read a ton into it. Look, Clinton was a popular President, who really did not do much of a good job with anything at all, was caught perjuring, and was even more scandalous than the uber-libs think Bush is.

Thus, not only in usage but officially India and Bharat are both accorded primary status. The name India is derived from the river Indus.\n\nThe original name of the river came from the fact that in the north-west of the subcontinent, there are seven main tributaries of the one river. The local inhabitants therefore called it Sapta-Sindhu, meaning the seven rivers. As the seven tributaries are part of the one river, the entire river system came to be known in time as Sindhu. In general, Sindhu also means any river or water body in Sanskrit.\n\nPersian explorers visited the area even in ancient times, and the Iranian 'h' is cognate with Sanskrit 's'. Thus Sindhu became Hindu. Similarly, Sanskrit Asura (a spirit, later an evil spirit) is cognate with Ahura, the Supreme God of the early Iranian people.\n\nThe name of the river entered Greek from Persian, with the loss of the initial 'h', to become ÎÎ½Î´ÏÏ Indos, from which the Greeks derived their name for the region, ÎÎ½Î´Î¹Î± India. The Latin form of Indos is Indus, the name by which the river system is still known in the West. Its name was given to the entire subcontinent by the Romans, who adapted it to the current India.\n\nThe word India is the form used by Europeans over the ages.\n\nSindhu is also the Sanskrit term for Ocean and for any large water body. It would specifically mean the modern river Indus, if ancient Indic originated there. It could just mean ""water dwellers"" as well.\n\nInterestingly, the Vedas did not assign any particular name for India, although some scholars assert that references to Indu in the Rig Veda relate to India's present name. Many traditional literary/cultural works from around the globe lack definite terminology for their home culture as a political unit; China, Greece, and many other civilizations lacked fixed names for themselves in traditional literature of their early periods.\n\nIn the Matsya Purana 126, the length of India (Bharatavarsa) is 9,000 puranic yojanas, which is a good estimation.[1]\n\nListed by, among others, Colonel James Todd in his Annals of Rajputana, he describes the ancient India under control of tribes claiming descent from the Moon, or ""Indu"", and their influence in Trans-Indian regions where they referred to the land as Industhan. This explanation might serve better to explain the term Hindu. Having said that, ancient Greeks do mention the Indic tribes or related tribes (could be of Iranian origin or joint Indo-Iranian origin) inhabiting what is now Ukraine as Sindoi or Sindkoi.\n\nThe name India was known in Anglo-Saxon, and was used in King Alfred's translation of Orosius. In Middle English, the name was, under French influence, replaced by Ynde or Inde, which entered early modern English as Indie. The use of the name India dates from the 17th century onwards, and may be due to the influence of Latin, or Spanish or Portuguese. [2]\n\nBhÄrata\n Some people regard Emperor Bharata to be the first and only emperor to rule all of India. Shown here is the approximate extent of his reign, Bharatvarsha,BhÄrata, sometimes BhÄratavarsha (BhÄrat or BhÄratvarsha in Hindi) is the name in Sanskrit and many languages of India for northern India. The Hindi form is also an official name of the Republic of India, and possibly the earliest name given to the nation. (Article 1 of the Constitution of India - 'India that is Bharat shall be a Union of States.'). In Sanskrit, it is pronounced as [bÊ±aËrÉtÌªÉ] while in Hindi as [bÊ±aËrÉtÌª\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etymology_of_India"
3704,10,"I like some Conservatives and some Liberals. Personally, I try to look beyond the ""outer shell"" and instead focus on the person. Many moderate Liberals have more in common with Conservatives than they do with ""extremist"" Liberals, and conversely, many moderate Conservatives have more in common with Liberals than they do with ""extremist"" Conservatives. \n\nConsequentially, in a lot of cases these names are actually misnomers because they carry âpreloadedâ connotations that may not even be true. Major problems arise from slapping these broad labels on people because they encourage polarization rather than unity. In fact, the labels ""Conservative"" and ""Liberal"" have such extraordinarily negative connotations that they are used like socially acceptable profanity. You only need to spend a few minutes on Answers.com to see what I'm talking about. \n\nInterestingly, most people never really think about how they developed their beliefs.

3738,10,"When you get down to it, the goal of war is to kill the other guy before he kills you right? \n\nSo the only issue is not one of whether or not they are violent. You WANT violent people in the military. It gives them a constructive outlet for those tendancies. It's a matter of whether or not they are capable of serving.  Using criminal offenses or at risk youths as our front line soldiers would have another significant advantage. The PTS disorder would become rather rare. These are kids that have been shot at since a young age.  So nothing new there. In war they get to shoot back and not worry about being arrested. \n\nMost importantly, most crime is a convegence of many factors. Giving people a chance for something other than life in and out of prison then right back to the crime filled neighborhood they came out of is one way to break the cycle for many of these people. Being a soldier is an honorable proffesion. If these kids off the street who are willing were to obtain training and education from the Military in return for risking their lives to protect the country. Then many would avoid lives as career criminals. Many crimes would be prevented. Crime ridden neighborhoods would decline. The cycle broken and a certain number returning to inspire the new generation to get out into the world and see beyond the graffit encrusted walls to the opportunites that await even the poorest American. Hard to see that when every day the cops treat you like a criminal no matter if you are doing anything wrong. When life is a struggle, higher education a pipe dream and opportunity means working a dead end job for low wages until you die or hurt yourself bad enough to earn disability. \n\nSo unless it's a sexual crime or cold blooded murder I'd move all that chose to do so to a sentence in the military. \n\nDetractors like to pretend the military is too complex for ""criminals"" to understand. Sorry but if farm kids and inner city youths are already doing it then why not more farm kids and inner cities youths which are the bulk of those in prison today not be able to do the same? It's not intelligence, it's a lack of opportunity that creates crime. \n\nThe second issue is one of keeping corruption down in the military. This is a more difficult task. Again it relies on volenteers and the fact that if one of those given alternate sentencing screws up they get a max sentence. Once in for a time, promotions, the potential for retirement, built in discipline and friendships will make them no more likely to commit a crime as a soldier than any other soldier."

3760,10,"Taiwan was ceded to Japan in 1895.  Many researchers, commentators, political analysts, etc. say that Taiwan was returned to China in 1945, but that is completely false.  Up until the present day, Taiwan is a territory under the jurisdiction of the United States, and that situation has existed from WWII up to the present day.  (The fact that the USA is the only country in the world with a ""Taiwan Relations Act"" and that that Act is a domestic law of the USA further confirms this analysis.)\n\nHow did Taiwan come under the jurisdiction of the USA?  The same way that Iraq did -- via ""military conquest.""   After the Declaration of War against the Empire of Japan on Dec. 8, 1941, all military attacks against Taiwan were conducted by US military forces.  Hence, the United States is/will be the ""principal occupying power"" of Taiwan.    All legal relationships for Taiwan in the post-WWII era arise from these facts. \n\nWhen the Japanese troops in Taiwan surrendered on Oct. 25, 1945, that marked the beginning of the military occupation of Taiwan.  (There was no transfer of sovereignty on that date.) The United States is the ""principal occupying power""  and it has delegated the military occupation of Taiwan to the Chinese Nationalists (i.e. ROC).   In Dec. 1949, high officials of the ROC in the mainland fled to Taiwan and became a ""government in exile.""  Why are they a ""government in exile""?  Because as of late 1949, Taiwan is being held under military occupation and has not been transferred to any country.   Thus the ROC is exercising ""effective territorial control"" over territory where it does not possess sovereignty. \n\nIn late April 1952, the post-war peace treaty came into effect.  Japan renounced the territorial sovereignty of Taiwan, but no recipient country was designated.  Under such circumstances, the territory remains under the jurisdiction of the ""principal occupying power,""  which is the United States. \n\nHence, the ROC on Taiwan has the dual roles of  (1) subordinate occupying power beginning Oct. 25, 1945, and (2) government in exile beginning late Dec. 1949.  \n\nThis explanation fully shows why the ROC on Taiwan is treated as an orphan by the international community, although under casual analysis the ROC appears to be a real country.    In fact (obviously) the ROC on Taiwan is not a country, because it does not have 'TITLE"" to the territory of ""Formosa and the Pescadores."" \n\nThe PRC maintains that Taiwan is a part of the PRC based on the Successor Government Theory.  This theory claims that since the ROC obtained the sovereignty of Taiwan on Oct. 25, 1945, and the PRC is the successor goverment to the ROC, so the PRC holds the sovereignty of Taiwan now.  The fatal flaw in this argument is that there was no transfer of sovereignty on Oct. 25, 1945.  \n\n(Why are most people are totally unfamiliar with the style of  reasoning presented above, and the conclusions reached?  It is because they do not research the subjects of the laws of war, territorial cession, international treaty law, etc. and their relationship to military government and military jurisdiction.)"

3788,10,"So, if I'm to be limited to your time frame, this would mean only Presidents since 1946, so which of these Presidents?\n\nHarry S. Truman\nDwight Eisenhower\nJohn Kennedy\nLyndon Johnson\nRichard Nixon\nGerald Ford\nJimmy Carter\nRonald Reagan\nGeorge H. W. Bush\nBill Clinton\nGeorge W. Bush\n\nEach has had his strengths, weaknesses, crisis's, conflicts and scandals but I'd order them like this and why:\n\nRonald Reagan - Gave America back it's pride after the 1980 election  against Jimmy Carter. Reagan broadened his appeal by espousing moderate policies, gaining much of his support from disaffected Democrats and blue-collar workers. The incoming administration immediately set out to âturn the government aroundâ with a new economic program. Over strenuous congressional opposition, Reagan pushed through his âsupply sideâ economic program to stimulate production and control inflation through tax cuts and sharp reductions in government spending. However, in 1982, as the economy declined into the worst recession in 40 years, and support for supply-side economics faded.\n\nNominated Sandra Day O'Connor as the first woman on the Supreme Court.  Reagan's place in history will rest, perhaps, on the short- and intermediate-range missile treaty consummated on a cordial visit to the Soviet Union  with the Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. Reagan could point to numerous domestic achievements as well: sharp cuts in income tax rates, creating economic growth without inflation, and reducing the unemployment rate.\n\nBill Clinton - Presided over the greatest economic expansion in our lifetime. Mastered the art of employing incremental, rather than large-scale, governmental action to effect change leaving the Republicans, with their announced mandate for fundamental change, to appear visionary and extreme. Having taken the center, and with stock markets continuing to boom and unemployment low, Clinton enjoyed high popularity, presiding over an enormous national surge in prosperity and innovation.\n\nDwight Eisenhower - Vastly underrated. preached a doctrine of Dynamic Conservatism. Maintained a conservative economic policy, with liberal social policies. Worked to reduce the size of government, contain inflation, and lower taxes., Simultaneously created the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.). His administration supported the civil-rights legislation that passed Congress (1957, 1960); and he prohibited discriminatory practices in the District of Columbia and in federal facilities such as navy yards and hospitals.\n\n\nJohn Kennedy - Promoted civil rights, space exploration, and made Americans hopeful with the promise of the ""New Frontier"". Yet his Presidencey lasted only slightly more than 1,000 days, he also set forward many changes to our nation that would  have lasting impact. \n\nHarry S. Truman - Truman was a folksy, unassuming president, and popularized phrases such as ""The buck stops here"" and ""If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen."" He overcame the low expectations of many, particularly in the shadow of his politically-dominant predecessor, and although he was forced out of his re-election campaign in 1952 due to low approval ratings, he is now commonly rated among the great Presidents by historians.\n\nLyndon Johnson -  adopted a far-reaching civil-rights bill, a voting-rights bill, a Medicare program for the aged, and measures to improve education and conservation. Congress also began what Johnson described as âan all-out warâ on poverty. The double tragedy of a war in Southeast Asia (which he himself escalated)and urban riots at home marked Johnson's last two years in office. Faced with disunity in the nation and challenges within his own party, Johnson surprised the country on March 31, 1968, with the announcement that he would not be a candidate for reelection.\n\nGeorge H. W. Bush - Bush pursued moderate policies in both domestic and "

Of course they will Purge the war on Terrorism, does anyone think that when a Democratic Government came to power they would instruct the CIA FBI Homeland security and all to lay of AlQueda!!! Of course not they would increase the security in our ports and Borders by reducing the amount of money spent in Iraq.  USA is not the world bank is it ???? why should the USA and the USA only be the sole supplier of ways to rebuild Iraq, hey Arabia is rich very rich as we all know, if the bordering countries to Iraq want peace in this country, let them cough up the moneytries for this purpose.\nThere is no link from Iraq to 9/11 all the people involved in 9/11 were Saudi fact!!!!! and how do you explain the London and Spain incedents and others, surly if all the Terrorists were purged from Iraq the london bombing could still have happend, so why are we spending $200 billion a year in Iraq $200 billion we could use badly in the USA!!\nI personally dont except that the World Economy is something America & Europe has to go along with. I would like to think that the Democratic party would give Tax incentives to Companys who build there Factorys in the USA employ American people and advertise that they are pulling for the American worker. \nIs it right that the GOP pulls for any worker but the American one!! Its all a cover up for the real truth that is "" The non European or American worker will accept less money an hour"" this is the real truth isnt it. So for starters the Democratic party will pull for the American worker inside the USA They will keep up the world wide war on Terror. And a Democratic Senate would move towards a National Health service, with some kind of means test and opt out for those who can afford Private Health Insurance, so that mothers no longer have to choose between Food or Medicine for there children in USA 2006, the truth is 50% of GOP adgenda is Democratic adgenda so nothing would change in most departments of Government, I mean our Armed forces are not Republican nor are the CIA FBI, they advise and obey the ruling party whoever they are.\nAs per your statements about Hillary Clinton, taking some of the Propaganda i have heard in the last 2 years to the ridiculous extent that some of you do, NO Mrs Clinton is not a AlQueda agent undercover, do you really believe this??? she wants Education in the USA to improve, she wants our Economy to thrive, Example she wants China to accept Exports from the USA, something not happening now \nI bet your sole bone of contention is :- does she agree with G W Bush on Iraq or not. full stop \nI would be interested if you have any other complaints about Hillarys Opinions; other than Iraq.and the War on terror."

Thus in the long run, the exchange rate between two countries should move towards the rate that equalises the prices of an identical basket of goods and services in each country. Our ""basket"" is a McDonald's Big Mac, which is produced in about 120 countries. The Big Mac PPP (purchasing-power parity) is the exchange rate that would mean hamburgers cost the same in America as abroad. Comparing actual exchange rates with PPPs indicates whether a currency is under- or overvalued. \n\nThe Bic Mac in the USA is 3.10 U.S.$ and in Australia  2.44 U.S.$ (or 3.25 Aus.$), so you have a -21% in Australia."

3817,10,"I was watching the history of the Roman Empire on (of course) the History Channel yesterday. And it basically was the story of one dysfunctional or corrupt or tyrannical Emperor after the other (and the power hungry women who loved them) and I got to thinking - why do we expect so much from our modern day politicians? Clearly the Roman emperors had (in a joint sense) every bad quality a person put in power could ever have - they often womanized, the often killed (some killed a lot), and they often took advantage. In short, they mostly just took advantage of their positions of power. They got the six-on-the-side-lovers, the special in-palace-running-water, and the right to exercise their natural and dominant tendencies to be in charge (I learned that Emperor Claudius had no such tendancies - he hid behind a curtain after Emperor Gaius was killed by his own guards and was then literally forced to be the new Emperor).\nSo here we are in this modern âcivilizedâ society (my kids have a Sony Play Station) and we expect so much from our representatives. We demand their integrity and honesty. And weâre so outraged when they get caught playing Emperor. But why? On the basis of what? Has manâs morality really evolved all that much since the Roman Empire? Wasnât it just a handful of decades ago that a guy maned Hitler tried to forcibly and violently take over the world? So our guys (and I live in America but your guys in other so called civilized nations should easily follow the paradigm) are suddenly going to change from historical trends and not only really CARE about the people, but care enough to focus on the peopleâs needs and not their own? What a joke. When politicians get caught taking bribes, smoking pot, killing someone (how many people do you know personally who die under mysterious circumstances?) or shacking up with their sixteen year old intern, itâs nothing but the HISTORICAL NORM. Theyâre just following suit. Itâs only by the sheer fact that theyâre no longer held above the law that they donât OPENLY engage in the Roamesq things of the past. In fact when they do get caught they seen to find ways to use their positions to get out of trouble anyway. I wonder what would happen if a guy named Rocco Fabricchi the plumber from Brooklyn ran his beat up Toyota in to his neighborâs fence and then said, âOops I took some sleeping pills and donât remember a thing.â What about if you ran your car off a bridge with your brotherâs former secretary in side and left her to die? You do nothing for nine hours and they charge you with nothing but âleaving the scene of an accidentâ? Would they just charge you and me with âleaving the scene of an accidentâ? Or would you get at least a vehicular or negligent homicide charge? Well you get the picture. The new age politicians are doing just like the Roman Emperors - theyâre just doing it quietly in the background with a nice custom made suit. We need o learn from human history and stop expecting so much."

Do you think you deserve to be out, seeing as you aren't taking the paid-for privilege of your bond (meaning your promise, my man) seriously?\nI am sorry for coming down hard on you, but getting busted should be a wake-up call to you, not business as usual. Getting busted is SUPPOSED to be a life-changing event, and you don't seem to be letting it sink in as such. Yes, a lot of people get busted. Yes, you don't need to be a wuss about it. And yes, you probably know in your heart of hearts that you screwed up royally.\nBut think of it this way; while you were in stir the first time (when you are awaiting bond), I am sure you saw some pretty hard folk in there. I am not talking about hard as in violent felon-types, but hard in the way that they are too hard-headed or stupid to get out of the way of those self-made obstacles that block their own attempts at a good life - a life worth living.\nDude, you have to decide if you want to be one of those people, 'coz getting out on bond and breaking more laws doesn't say you are smart; it says you need to be forced to make legal choices. You hurt yourself by not even making an attempt to stay out of trouble.\nYou may need new friends or surroundings or just new habits; if you don't alter these things, I can absolutely guarantee that the state will be happy to alter your surroundings for you, aka, jail or prison. Since it seems like your offense is alcohol-related, get your behind into a program TODAY. Not tomorrow: TODAY. You may not think you are an alcoholic, but if you are getting busted for alcohol-related offenses, it is time you own up to the fact that you and booze are bad together, and you need help getting away from it.\nThis is all about you, and you MUST accept and own your own mistakes, or you will continue to repeat them. The courts, while still proactive and willing to give you a chance (thus you being able to bond out in the first place), hate being made into fools. That is what you have done here. \nSo, this is what you do: after you call AA and find the nearest meeting, call your lawyer. If they are not in, leave a message. Do NOT spring this on them at court, because lawyers hate not being prepared, and they will look like a fool when the prosecutor brings it up (and they WILL bring it up) to secure a win. that is how prosecutors work; their job is to make you look like the dumb*** you have certainly been. Your lawyer needs to think up a strategy that takes into account your mistake.\nKeep calling the lawyer until you talk to him or her directly. You want to stay out of jail, make sure you give them more time to prepare rather than less. And go to the AA meeting. Work the program, so that when you go to court, you can show the judge that you know you have a problem (the screw-up while on bail), but are getting help for it.\nAnd for crying out loud, wake up, and take a different path than the one you are taking. It is not helping you, so ask for help."

3833,10,"To me it's my freedom and liberty as I seem to have little of either.  Most of the money I earn is taken away before I get it via taxes and then they take more in taxes when I spend it.  So if a dollar earned is 100% liberty, what % do I get to spend the way I want too.  Almost 40% is taken out before I get it.  That leaves 60%. Now if I buy anything I get hit with sales tax right off the bat.  Get the picture. I can't get on a greyhound bus without a government ID so where is my freedom?"

3835,10,"No, because where I live you can be fired for ANY reason or NO REASON AT ALL. Consider that I've also seen racially motivated firings where the people who lost their jobs had no rights or protection at all. Also in my state the labor board will only enforce minimum wage without a contract. I've seen people put in a two week notice at a job only to have their last paycheck dropped to minimum wage out of revenge for them leaving. These laws favor corporations, not workers rights at all. I see nothing fair about that. To change these laws in our favor I'd be willing to see a law mandating giving at least a weeks notice before quitting a job. And the employer has to accept it, not tell you just to hit the door because you put in a notice."
3836,10,Your question 'Assumes' there are benefits to the minimum wage. The true effect of the minimum wage is to prevent the employment of anyone with job skills not worth the minimum wage.

3845,10,"Absolutely. We already have two of the three branches elected (more or less) by the public, they provide an adequate check against the judiciary.\n\nThe problem with making the courts public is that the public is slow to change. Many important decisions would have been delayed by years, if not decades, if the courts had been elected.\n\nExamples : Roe v Wade (allowing abortion), Brown v. Board of education (end of segregation in schools), Lawrence v. Texas (decriminalizing sodomy).\n\nThe legislative and executive branches are elected by the public, and tend to represent the majority. Since the judiciary is often not, they tend to be more receptive to the needs of the minorities (non-Christians, women, children, African-Americans, gays, etc).\n\nRegarding Kelo : The SCOTUS merely ruled that local government can take private property for public use (with compensation, as mentioned in the Fifth Amendment). But the people still have the decision to vote for public officials who would choose not to do this."

3857,10,"Many things were going on.  The United States was in a war with England in 1815 and that was the year that the U.S. beat England in the Battle of New Orleans helping to bring that war to an end. \n\nThe United States was also in a war with Dey of Algiers. This was known as the The Second Barbary War (1815, also known as the Algerian War) was the second of two wars fought between the United States of America and the semi-autonomous North African city-states of Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli, known collectively as the Barbary States. It brought to a conclusive end the American practice of paying tribute to the pirate states.  The U.S. Military leaders were Commodores Stephen Decatur, Jr. and William Bainbridge.\n\nEngland was again at war with Napoleon after his escape from Elba.  With the British (and their allies) winning the Battle of Waterloo Napoleon abdicates and is taken to the island of St. Helena.  Ionian Islands come under the Protectorate of Great Britain.  The Corn Law is passed in England to maintain the price of food stuffs.\n\nIn 1832 Andrew Jackson was reelected President of the United States.  The U.S. defeated the Sacs and Foxes in Black Hawkâs War.  The crisis caused by the Nullification Act in South Carolina (with a threat of secession) is averted.  \n\nIn England is the passage of the English reform Bill.

America would get involved to help Israel, which would draw in Great Brittian, Russia, Poland (maybe France) on our side and set up WWIII. \nUS, England, Russia, Israel Vs. Palestine, Iran, Syria"

3877,10,"interesting question can we yes do we want to well thats just the problem isnt it.In order for there to be peace things must be fair and not just fair but equal.All men are not created equal as one might want to believe.some stronger some smarter some healther some with more drive to succeed and a multitude of needs to be met based on education and experiance and ability.If we take all these things into consideration meeting the needs of people becomes of primary importance and is a goal worth achieving . do super achievers have a responcibilty to under acheivers does some one who uses drugs and is lazy deserve as much as this person and what is the balance we wish to achieve in order to maintain a standard of living no one should fall under even if we must care intirely for them. If people would worrie less about what others do and only do there best with the talents given them by the gene pool they are part of then peace is very possible.simple rules of behaveuor for the well being of all people need to be established.cause no harm to others or the enviroment would be a good start and a court of justice not judgement to determine a reasonable sentence.reality is hard but fair, accidents happen but not that often and some one is usally responcible.work is for the good of all men and a position of respect to be valued by society not an employer people often place there desires above those of others and should be reconed with as a crime under do no harm .we can all share in the vast wealth of planet earth if man only respects his fellow man and doesnt take advantage of him.man needs changeing work to keep his mind active and stimulate learning which only enhances his life and those around him.your reward for great acheivment should be acknowledgement by those who benifit from your ability and shared with the world.good work should be rewarded with time off for family not huge pay checks.and more hours worked supporting those who hired you.restructure of laborand management needs to be along the lines of teaching working side by side the knowledge shared is expaned 10 fold throught the world and all benifit.you cant solve a problem by tossing money at it but creating a sence of need to fufill a need gives man the reward and satisfation of helping others.jobs with low skill levels that require simple instruction yet hard physical work should be rewarded equally as if they invented scotch tape peoplewho show a lazy streak may be great thinkers unable to concentrate on simple tasks or will ing to do them no matter there role in the community can be fufilled with community projects of shot duration with long term benifits .you build a road may be all thats need for awhile great numbers benifit from hard work on common projects.If i am rich and provide all the money to finance a deal should i be rewarded or scolded for hoarding and not sharing.baseing your worth on money is of little value its only a simple minded way of keeping score in a game set up with rules that are not equal at its inception .man is capable of peace but i dont think willing he is to greedy in his nature still and may be for 100""s of years to come."

When those people who want to whine, bitch, and moan about our troops, roll out of thier comfy bed, drink thier coffee, take a hot shower, and get in to thier air conditioned car they should thank thier lucky stars.  Thank those brave men and women who are thousands of miles from thier homes that you have the oppertunity to have those luxuries every morning. Also thank those of us who wake up every day alone in our beds,  eat our meals alone, wait days on end for the phone to ring so we can say I love you, just one more time, and dread the day that someone is going to come to our door to tell us that the last I love you was the last we would ever hear.  Send the message that you are there for all of us , because if it were not for those of us here at home our military would not have the strength to go out and do what they have to do, and if it were not for our military you would not have all the luxuries you have every day.

3885,10,"Here is a summary...but I assure you there are great resources online:\n\n At the start of the war, President Wilson had declared the neutrality of the United States. Most Americans opposed US involvement in the European war. But the sinking of the Lusitania and other German actions against civilians drew America sympathies to the Allies. German military leaders believed that they could still win the war by cutting off British supplies. They expected their U-boats to starve Britain into surrendering within a few months, longer before the US had fully prepared for war. Tension between the US and Germany increased after the British intercepted and decoded a message from Germany's foreign minister, Arthur Zimmermann, the German ambassador to Mexico. The message known as the ""Zimmermann note"", revealed a German plot to persuade Mexico to go to war against the United States. The British gave the message to Wilson, and it was published in the US early in March. Americans were further enraged after U-boats sank several US cargo ships."

3918,10,"There's plenty of things the United States' media ignore. That's just one of them. The truth is, the media have no interest in a dramatic change in government or in, worst case scenario, some revolutionary impeachment movement.

Black and White has lost a lot of it's teeth in the younger generations by which I mean ..15-40, I am white and hang with a near equal black and white ratio, all of my white friends are fiercely anti racist.. maybe because we got a lot of black friends or maybe because we're getting past that horrible barrier once and for all. I think you're on when you say it would draw the hostility out of the ignorant... but that would be a good thing because once revealed they would be rejected by the majority of non bigoted people of all walks...\nI would be totally content with any president male, female, black, white... whatever, as long as they were honest and fouthright.. \n and to be honest.. Obama is a politico man, which means he's got green in his blood,.. he lives in a $1.5 mansion that he bought through public service, how much does he care about you and I?

3926,10,"Yes Veterans day is a day to rejoice in the feedoms and liberty that many people take for granted.  It is to celebrate the fact that many brave men went off to war during WW1 (of which there are so few remaining), WW2 (numbers also dwindling), The Korean War, Vietnam and any other war torn countries that North American has lost it's youth.  Today you can include females in that mix also as there are many brave women who have gone to battle in the Gulf War and the oil war that is going on now.  I usually don't answer homework questions but feel that everyone should be aware of the brave sacrifices that these veterans gave in order for us to live as we do today.

3935,10,"Several years ago I was driving through Scottsdale  in an older model Buick station wagon with expired tags. As I pulled out of Wal Mart I passed a Scottsdale pig, as we passed we looked each other right in the eyes then he went for my tags put on the old brakes and hung a u-turn and proceeded in my direction. We were in a residential area so I hung a left into the neighborhood, I noticed several folks in their front yard, that were just coming or going, so I immediately pulled over in front pop ed out of the wagon and proceeded to walk up to the homeowner to ask him id a so & so lived there, just as I did the Scottsdale bear drove very slowly by, checking it all out , this time I made sure we made no eye contact and he kept on going; thank you Lord!  He spotted the bad tags , but there is a rule of thumb with cops that unless you bolt on them or haul ass away, the further you can remove yourself from the inital point of contact, then they may, or may not hit you up. I sashayed back to the Buick and bolted out of Dodge."

3937,10,"To answer your last question, yes, I feel this way too. Jesus did not condone hypocrites- like some people in our government, and he does not condone the rest of us blindly following them. I am not a libertarian, as you suggest you might be, but I definitely agree that the current people running things are not promoting  the best interests of the people.

3943,10,"The Privacy Rules of HIPAA allow the individual to regain control over individually identifiable health information. The individual is guaranteed right of access to inspect and obtain a copy of PHI within 30 days of a request. If the covered entity denies the request in whole or in part, it must provide the individual with a written denial specifying the reasons for the denial, which is appealable by the individual (45 CFR Â§ 164.524, 2002).\n\nIn addition, the individual also has the right to amend his or her PHI, such as medical records. If the entity fails to amend as specified by the individual, the individual may appeal this decision as well (45 CFR Â§ 164.526, 2002). The individual must first make his or her appeal through the covered entity's administrative procedures. Thereafter, the decisions may be appealable to the Secretary of the DHHS.\n\nAn individual also has the right to receive an accounting of disclosures of PHI made by a covered entity for the last 6 years prior to the date the accounting is requested. Although there are some exceptions, the individual's request for the accounting must be produced within 60 days of the request (45 CFR Â§ 164.528, 2002).\n\nPerhaps one of the most significant controls the individual has over his or her PHI is the ability to request restrictions on a covered entity's use and disclosure of PHI, even when the rules allow otherwise. While a covered entity is not required to agree to an individual's requested restriction, in the event the entity does agree to the restriction, the covered entity can only use or disclose the information for emergency treatment purposes. Furthermore, the restriction can only be terminated by the individual or the covered entity, but only after the individual is informed of the termination (45 CFR Â§ 164.52, 2002)."

3947,10,"Assimilation is a cultural thing. Culture is define by the behavior, traditions, customs, religion, and language of a civilization. The Mexican culture has no similarities to the European. This is why it is a difficult process and takes several generations to partially assimilate to the American Culture. The American culture is a combination of many cultures and differs from region to region. The technology you mention has nothing to do with a human condition. And if talking about globalization, these social problems were foreseen and it is all up to us to solve them with tolerance and be more objective instead of personal. Globalization means the globe will close in and we need to share what resources we have, protect what we have left of them and be reasonable or  we can help destroy it, it's our choice."

I would also go to Management and tell them that she is a trouble maker and is spreading vicious rumours and they need to stop her, especially while she is working because she is giving the store a bad reputation.

3991,10,"Hmm,\n\nThis is a good question. For starters I'm going to assume that by Europe you mean the European Union, since some countries in Europe don't belong to it.\n\nThe European Union (EU) is an intergovernmental and supranational union of 25 democratic member states having territory on or sociopolitical connections with the European continent. (www.wikipedia.org)\n\nThe Union nowadays has a common single market, [2] consisting of a customs union, a single currency (the euro) managed by the European Central Bank (adopted by 12 of the 25 member states), a Common Agricultural Policy, a common trade policy, a Common Fisheries Policy, and a Common Foreign and Security Policy. (www.wikipedia.org)\n\nIn lamer terms, it is a group of European countries (mostly for the moment) that got together and decided to unify their economies in one single currency also unifying certain policies (like trade, immigration, etc..).\n\nIt is very interesting since the different countries continue being politically independent but have certain unified policies. As opposed to the States within the USA which depend of a Federal Government.\n\nI would say it is an ""in between"" or hybrid of Unified States under federal law and a Free Trade agreement, like Cafta or NAFTA.\n\nI hope this answers your question."
