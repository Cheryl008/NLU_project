  Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
  the U.K. Was growing more impatient with Japanese trade
  barriers and warned that it would soon have new powers against
  countries not offering reciprocal access to their markets.
      She told Parliament that the bid by the U.K.'s Cable and
  Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> to enter the Japanese telecommunications
  market was being regarded by her government as a test case.
      ""I wrote to the prime minister of Japan, Mr Nakasone, on the
  fourth of March to express our interest on the Cable and
  Wireless bid. I have not yet had a reply. We see this as a test
  on how open the Japanese market really is,"" Thatcher said.
      Thatcher told Parliament that ""shortly ... We shall have
  more powers than we have now, when, for example the powers
  under the Financial Services Act and the Banking Act become
  available, then we shall be able to take action in cases where
  other countries do not offer the same full access to financial
  services as we do.""
      Cable and Wireless is seeking a stake in the proposed
  Japanese telecommunications rival to Kokusai Denshin Denwa.

18,2,"FED'S HELLER URGES BROAD REFORM TO AID BANKING
  Federal Reserve Board Governor
  Robert Heller said the banking system could be strengthened by
  permitting formation of financial services holding companies
  involved in areas like banking, insurance, real estate and
  securities.
      In a speech prepared for delivery in New York to the Bank
  and Financial Analysts' Association, Heller said, ""I believe
  that increased diversification along geographic and product
  lines is the key to strengthening the American banking system.""
      He said he supported the idea of financial services holding
  companies advocated by the Association of Bank Holding
  Companies in which regulation of various bank, thrift,
  insurance, investment, securities and real estate subsidiaries
  would be handled on functional lines.
      ""Limits would be placed on the extension of credit by the
  bank to the associated institutions, and all transactions would
  have to be on an arms-length basis,"" Heller said.
      Measures would be necessary to avoid abuse of the banks'
  special position by such holding companies or subsidiaries.
      Heller said he ""would require the holding company to serve
  as a 'source of strength' to the bank by making a commitment to
  maintain the bank's capital.
      ""In other words, the bank would not be allowed to fail as
  long as the holding company has a positive net worth.""
      Heller also said commercial enterprises should be permitted
  to own a financial services holding company, again with the
  provision that capital would flow to the financial enterprise
  if necessary.
      Heller said the effects of these actions ""would be banks
  that are at least as strong as the corporations holding them"" in
  which customer deposits were assured while any incentive to
  ""loot the bank"" was removed.
      Such diversification would give access to national and
  international financial services to corporations across the
  United States.
      Heller said that would mean ""the steady decline of America's
  banks in the world financial league tables would be arrested"" by
  permitting them to become more competitive.

  British Petroleum Co Plc does not
  intend to raise the price of its planned 70 dlr per share offer
  for the publicly held 45 pct of Standard Oil Co, BP Managing
  Director David Simon said.
      ""We don't seen this as any progressive bidding game,"" he
  told reporters at a news conference. BP now owns 55 pct of
  Standard's stock.
      Simon said BP had carefully considered the amount of its
  planned bid and he quoted an oil analyst, whom he would not
  identify, as saying BP's careful evaluation means the company
  is not going to raise its offer.
      ""I think that (an increase) would be totally wrong. I think
  the price is very fair and it is much to early to speculate
  about ligigation,"" he said. ""Let's wait and see how the offer
  runs.""
      Another official declined to speculate under what
  circumstances BP might raise its bid.
      The BP official said the 70 dlrs a share offer is 7.2 times
  Standard's 1986 cash flow and 56 pct above an independent
  evaluation of the company's assets, including the value of its
  oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas reserves.
      He said the price Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD> &lt;SC> paid
  for publicly held Shell Oil Co shares in 1985 was 5.1 times
  cash flow.
      The BP official also said the 70 dlr bid is a 40 pct
  premium over Standard's stock price over the past year.
      BP Group Treasurer Rodney Chase said more than half to as
  much as two-third's of the 7.4 billion dlrs BP needs for its
  offer will come from existing sources. The rest will be
  financed by new debt.
      BP will draw in cash from its operating companies around
  the world and is also arranging a five billion dlr line of
  credit, he explained.
      The company's debt to equity ratio will rise 11 or 12
  percentage points from the current 33 pct if the offer is
  completed, Chase said. But the ratio will be back below 40 pct
  within 12 months, he added.
      Chase also said 50 to 60 pct of Standard Oil's publicly
  held shares are held by financial institutions.
      Simon said Standard's board was informed of the offer on
  March nine and has been considering it since that time.
      He said BP does not expect any regulatory problems that
  would delay completion of the acquisition. ""We have informed
  Washington of our intentions and we've already been an integral
  part of ownership of U.S. oil reserves,"" he pointed out.
      Simon said there is a good chance that current world oil
  prices of about 18 dlrs a barrel could be maintained, and that
  the more stable market is due mostly to changes in policy in
  Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members to control oil production.
      ""We think there are signals that current conditions are
  more favorable than they have been for sometime,"" Simon said.
      ""We have hopes for greater stability, but we do not see
  prices going much higher,"" he added.

  USX Corp chairman David Roderick said
  the company had ended talks with British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP>
  about the possible sale of some energy assets and said USX has
  no immediate restructuring plans for its oil businesses.
      ""We have terminated our discussions,"" Roderick told Reuters
  after a speech to the Petroleum Equipment Suppliers Association
  here. He said USX was not conducting talks with any other
  possible buyer of its energy assets.
      Earlier today, BP said it planned to offer 70 dlrs per
  share for the Standard Oil Co's &lt;SRD> publicly held stock.
      USX said in December the company had held formal
  discussions with BP about the potential sale of some of its
  overseas oil assets and USX had received expressions of
  interest from a half dozen other oil companies.
      Roderick, in response to a question, said USX had no
  immediate plans to restructure its Marathon Oil Co, or Texas
  Oil and Gas Corp. He said USX also did not plan to sell any of
  its 49 pct interest in the giant Yates Field in west Texas.
      ""We want to maintain our production in the Yates Field
  during these difficult times,"" Roderick added.
      In response to a question, Roderick also said he did not
  know whether Australian investor Robert Holmes a Court was
  accumulating USX stock. In recent days, traders have suggested
  Holmes a Court was buying additional shares.
      Roderick said Carl Ichan, who terminated an eight billion
  dlr hostile takeover plan for USX in January, continued to hold
  a sizable interest in the company. ""Mr. Ichan still apparently
  has 11.4 pct. He hasn't bought any more stock or sold any,""
  Roderick said. ""He's a very satisfied shareholder right now. I
  talk with him monthly.""
      In his speech, Roderick predicted the fall in the value of
  the dollar would set the stage for the U.S. to solve its trade
  deficit problem which totaled 170 billion dlrs in 1986.
      ""I expect by the early 1990s the U.S. will be running a net
  trade surplus,"" Roderick said. ""I think the worst is over and
  we can look forward to stability and upward movement ahead.""
      However, the USX chairman warned that European trading
  partners may resist the turn in the U.S. trade deficit. ""Some
  economic discomfort must be transferred from the United States
  to our friends, trading partners and allies.""

77,2,"BP &lt;BP> MAY HAVE TO RAISE BID -  ANALYSTS
  British Petroleum Co PLC may have to
  raise its planned 70 dlrs a share tender offer for the publicly
  traded shares of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD>, analysts said.
      ""There's a lot of speculation here that someway or other
  they would be forced to come up with another bid,"" said Rosario
  Ilaqua of L.F. Rothschild.
      And despite BP managing director David Simon's denial today
  that BP would raise the offer, the analysts said that remained
  a distinct possibility.
      Analysts said they base their thinking on Royal Dutch/Shell
  Group's &lt;RD> &lt;SC> bid to buy the outstanding stake of Shell Oil
  Co in 1984 and 1985. Royal Dutch/Shell eventually raised its
  initial 55 dlrs a share offer to 60 dlrs a share, after
  lawsuits by minority shareholders.
      ""I think they're going to have to go a little higher
  eventually, just as Royal Dutch/Shell had to go a little higher
  for the Shell Oil minority shares,"" Bruce Lazier of Prescott
  Ball and Turben said. He estimated a price of 75 dlrs a share.
      Royal Dutch/Shell offered 55 dlrs a share for the 30.5 pct
  of Shell Oil it did not already own in January of 1984. After
  objections from minority shareholders about the price, Royal
  Dutch/Shell raised its bid and began a 58 dlrs a share tender
  offer in April 1984.
      But shareholders sued and a court blocked completion of the
  offer. After months of wrangling over the worth of Shell Oil,
  Royal Dutch/Shell agreed to another two dlrs increase.
      It ended up paying 5.67 billion dlrs for the outstanding
  Shell Oil stake, a significant premium to its original bid of
  about 5.2 billion dlrs.
      The analysts made their comments before Simon's remarks at
  a BP press conference in New York this afternoon.
      Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc told
  clients this morning that a sweetened offer was possible. The
  analyst said the bid could be raised by two dlrs a share.
      Analysts do not expect regulatory hurdles because of the
  Royal Dutch/Shell group precedent. But there may be shareholder
  lawsuits for the same reason, they said.
      Goldman Sachs and Co, BP's investment advisor, advised the
  Shell Oil board in 1984 and 1985.

86,1,"UNILEVER HAS IMPROVED MARGINS, VOLUMES IN 1986
  Unilever Plc &lt;UN.A> and NV group reported
  improvements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of
  five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling
  prices, disposals and currency movements, Unilever Plc chairman
  Michael Angus said.
      He told reporters that volumes in North America increased
  some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct
  after being flat for some years.
      Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentrating
  activities on core businesses, had now been completed, he
  noted.
      But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategic
  acquisitions taking place ""from time to time,"" he said.
      The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax
  profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously.
  In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level dropped
  three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion.
      Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc
  &lt;CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any
  earnings dilution.
      However, it would not add much to profits, with much of the
  company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs.
      Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing
  - debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986
  from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about
  40 pct by end-1987.
      The same divergence was made in full year dividend, with
  Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever
  Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line with
  the change in attributable profit.
      Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of
  Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he said
  that there was no target date for completing the process.
      He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to
  realise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough had
  paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, which
  operates outside Unilever's core activities.
      In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business,
  considerable expansion in the household products business and
  in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase.
      However, he noted that the U.S. Household products business
  had turned in a planned loss, with fourth quarter performance
  better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs
  of its Surf detergents.

87,2,"STANDARD OIL &lt;SRD> SEES BOOST IN 1987 CASH FLOW
  Standard Oil Co expects the sale of
  assets and federal tax refunds resulting from last year's loss
  to add about one billion dlrs to its normal cash flows from
  operations in 1987, its annual report said.
      Last year, the report noted, the cash flow from operations
  dropped to 1.8 billion dlrs from 3.5 billion dlrs in 1985 and
  3.2 billion dlrs in 1984 due principally to lower oil prices.
      The report, prepared before British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP>
  disclosed plans to seek the rest of Standard's stock, put 1987
  capital spending at 1.6 billion dlrs, down from the 1.7 billion
  dlrs projected in January.
      Standard's capital spending totaled 1.77 billion dlrs in
  1986.
      The report showed a decline in proven oil reserves to 2.41
  billion barrels at the end of 1986 from 2.65 billion barrels a
  year earlier as discoveries and other additions dropped to 11.4
  mln barrels last year from 23.2 mln in 1985.
      But it said gas reeserves rose to 7.31 trillion cubic feet
  from 7.22 trillion at the end of 1985 despite a 30.9 mln cubic
  feet downward revision in previous reserve estimates during
  1986. Discoveries and other additions totaled 200.5 billion
  cubic feet last year, up from 175.9 billion in 1985, it added.
      Standard said both oil and gas production increased last
  year -- to 726,600 barrels per day from 719,700 barrels the
  previous day and to 154.4 mln cubic feet daily from 10.1 mln in
  1985.
      But the average sales price of both dropped -- to 13.83
  dlrs per barrel from 26.43 dlrs for oil in 1985 and to 1.49
  dlrs per thousand cubic feet from 2.18 dlrs a year earlier.
      Standard said its refined product sales also rose last
  year, to 644,500 barrels per day from 604,200 barrels daily in
  1985.

      The charge will be made against the allowance for possible
  loan losses, and the writedown is of other real estate.
      Great American said the examiners were conducting a regular
  examination and a final report is not expected for several
  weeks. Management intends to include the charge and writedown
  in response to the preliminary findings.
      Great American said regulatory authorities are not
  requiring an adjustment of the previously reported financial

      However, Great American has revised its previous estimates
  of provisions for possible losses and has added 9.9 mln dlrs to
  the allowance account as of December 31, 1986. It said it took
  the action since the charge-offs will significantly deplete its
  allowance for possible loan losses and the economic environment
  does not show signs for significant improvement in the near
  future.
      It said the additional provision increases the allowance to
  26.4 mln dlrs, representing 6.63 pct of the outstanding loan

      The British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L> unit attributed the

122,1,"JARDINE MATHESON PLANS FOUR-FOR-ONE BONUS ISSUE
  Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd
  &lt;JARD.HKG> said it planned a bonus issue of four new ""B"" shares
  of 20 H.K. Cents each for every ordinary share of par value two
  dlrs.
      A company statement said the firm expects to pay a total
  1987 dividend of four cents per ""B"" share, while the ""A"" share
  dividend will be maintained at last year's level of 40 cents a
  share.
      Jardine Matheson announced earlier a 205 pct jump in 1986
  net profits to 479 mln dlrs from 157 mln in 1985.
      Shareholders' funds increased to 5.02 billion dlrs from
  4.77 billion in 1985, the statement said.
      It quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying Jardine Matheson
  achieved the good performance through satisfactory results in
  most sections, especially Hong Kong Land Co Ltd &lt;HKLD.HKG>,
  Jardine Fleming Co Ltd, and its business in Japan.
      He said the group's stake of about 35 pct in Hong Kong
  Land, which will be lowered to 26 pct after the completion of a
  reorganisation, is ""a long term investment and now stands at a
  level which causes us no financial strain or problems of asset
  imbalance.""
      Keswick said the issue of new ""B"" shares will give the group
  ""the flexibility in the future to issue ordinary shares for
  expansion without jeopardising the shareholding stability which
  has been brought about through the group's recent
  restructuring.""
      He said the new issue is pending approval from both the
  firm's shareholders and warrant holders, adding an appropriate
  adjustment will be made to the warrant exercise price.
      The Jardine group has nearly completed its reorganisation,
  with Jardine Matheson transferring its control of Hk Land to
  the new unit &lt;Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd>.
      Jardine Strategic will also hold majority stakes in the two
  companies spun off from Hk Land -- &lt;Mandarin Oriental
  International Ltd> and &lt;Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd>
  -- plus cross holdings with Jardine Matheson.
      Jardine Matheson, which had debts of about 2.7 billion dlrs
  last year, will become debt free after the restructuring.
      ""A positive cash flow from operations and disposals,
  continuing into 1987, has transformed our balance sheet,""
  Keswick said. He noted the firm last year sold interests in
  airfreight operations, Australian properties and trucking
  business, and its remaining U.S. Oil and gas activities.
      Jardine Matheson decided to make a provision against its
  general trading business in the Middle East in view of the
  continuing weakness of oil prices, Keswick said. But he said
  the operations would be profitable in the longer term.
      He said the firm's function ""has evolved into one primarily
  of strategy, structure and financial and personnel policy.""
      He said Jardine Matheson will reduce the size of the board
  of directors but will simultaneously create a new Pacific
  regional board. He gave no further details of the change.
      Jardine Matheson shares rose 20 cents to 24.90 dlrs at
  midday on the Hong Kong stock market. In early trading it had
  fallen to 24.30 dlrs because of rumours yesterday that the firm
  planned a rights issue.

123,1,"BHP SEES STRONG FOURTH QUARTER BUT LOWER YEAR NET
  The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S>
  said it expects a strong full year result, helped by sigificant
  investment allowance credits in the fourth quarter, but net
  will fall short of the record 988.2 mln dlrs earned in 1985/86
  ended May 31.
      The group earlier reported its net earnings dropped to
  603.0 mln dlrs in the first three quarters ended February 28
  from 813.0 mln a year earlier.
      Third quarter net fell to 206.0 mln dlrs from 238.6 mln a
  year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter ended November
  31, BHP said in a statement.
      Earnings in the first nine months were at the lower end of
  share analysts' forecasts yesterday of a range of 600 mln to
  620 mln dlrs.
      BHP held its annual dividend unchanged at 37.5 cents after
  declaring a steady final dividend of 20 cents and announced a
  one-for-five bonus issue to shareholders registered May 1.
      The bonus is being made from reserves which will not
  qualify for tax-free distribution after the introduction of
  dividend imputation next July 1.
      The bonus shares will not rank for the final dividend, BHP
  said.
      BHP said it should not be expected that the present rate of
  dividend will be maintained on the increased capital.
      The level of future dividends will be influenced by the
  implications of the proposed dividend imputation legislation,
  it said.
      As previously reported, dividends will become tax-free in
  shareholders' hands provided they are paid out of profits that
  have borne the full 49 pct company tax rate.
      BHP, which confined comment to the third quarter, said
  petroleum net earnings dropped to 98.8 mln dlrs from 139.6 mln
  a year earlier, and steel profit to 27.0 mln from 48.8 mln.
      BHP said the petroleum division earnings fall reflected
  generally lower oil prices and sales volumes from Bass Strait
  while the steel decline was due to a five pct fall in domestic
  sales and higher costs associated with the commissioning of new
  plant and some operational difficulties.
      The rise in third quarter minerals net to 95.7 mln dlrs
  from 81.5 mln a year earlier largely reflected the increase in
  ownership of the Mt Newman iron ore project, it said.
      The 60.7 mln dlr extraordinary gain, all in the third term,
  reflected a 240.7 mln profit on the sale of &lt;Blue Circle
  Southern Cement Ltd> offset by a U.S. Oil acreage writedown.

125,2,"JAPAN ACTS TO COOL U.S. ANGER ON TELECOMS DISPUTE
  Japan has sought to assure the U.S. It is
  not trying to keep foreign equity in a new Japanese
  international telecommunications company below the legal limit
  of 33 pct, a Post and Telecommunications ministry official
  said.
      In a letter sent yesterday, Postal Minister Shunjiro
  Karasawa told U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige that the
  ministry does not object to foreign participation by those U.S.
  Firms that have expressed interest.
      But it does oppose any foreign international
  telecommunications carrier having a management role, he said.
      The move appears to be an effort to dampen U.S. Opposition
  to the planned merger of two rival firms seeking to compete
  with the current monopoly &lt;Kokusai Denwa Denshin Co Ltd>, and
  to reduce the share held in any KDD rival by U.K.'s Cable and
  Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L>, industry analysts and diplomats said.
      One of the rival firms, &lt;International Telecom Japan Inc>
  (ITJ) has offered a stake in the company to eight U.S. Firms
  including General Electric Co &lt;GE>, Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and
  Citibank NA &lt;CCI), and two European companies, ITJ president
  Nobuo Ito said yesterday.
      Cable and Wireless holds a 20 pct share in a second
  potential KDD rival, &lt;International Digital Communications
  Planning Inc>, along with &lt;C Itoh and Co>. Merrill Lynch and Co
  Inc &lt;MER> and Pacific Telesis International Inc &lt;PAC>, both of
  the U.S., Hold three and 10 pct shares respectively.
      The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has urged the
  merger of the two firms because it says the market can only
  support a single KDD competitor.
      It has also rejected management participation by an
  international common carrier, such as Cable and Wireless,
  arguing no international precedent for such a stake exists.
      Cable and Wireless Director of Corporate Strategy, Jonathan
  Solomon, yesterday again told ministry officials he opposes a
  merger proposal that would limit Cable and Wireless' share to
  less than three pct and total foreign participation to about 20
  pct, the ministry official said.
      Channeling the U.S. Firms into a single merged competitor
  would most probably result in diluting Cable and Wireless'
  share, industry analysts said.
      ""Eventually the ministry will get what it wants -- one
  combined competitor,"" Bache Securities (Japan) Ltd analyst
  Darrell Whitten said.
      ""Political ... Leverage may get the total foreign share up
  to a certain amount, but you won't find any one company with an
  extraordinarily large holding,"" Whitten said.
      Western diplomatic sources were more blunt.
      ""They (the ministry) don't want to see Cable and Wireless
  with a reasonable share and they think of all sorts of
  strategies to reduce that share,"" one said.
      Fumio Watanabe, a senior Keidanren (a leading business
  organization) official who has been trying to arrange the
  merger, will present a new outline of his proposal on Thursday,
  the ministry official said.

  from 942.89 mln.
      MMAL, 99 pct-owned by Mitsubishi Motors Corp &lt;MIMT.T> and
  Mitsubishi Corp &lt;MITT.T>,  said a tight market meant it had
  failed to recover 19 mln dlrs in costs sustained because of a
  weak Australian dollar.
      The company said its Magna car dominated its market segment
  with sales of 30,500 units against 26,900 in 1985. Total sales
  were 64,100, down 15,900.
      In addition, export of components to Japan increased with
  15 mln dlrs invested in 1986 to expand output of aluminium
  cylinder heads to 26,000 per month from 6,000, MMAL said.
      Imported passenger car, light commercial and heavy vehicle
  sales suffered while local-manufacturing profitability was
  eroded by sales substantially below production capacity, it
  said.
      Australian car sales fell to 530,000 in 1985 from 696,000

      BIL said in a statement the offer is conditional on minimum
  acceptances totalling 30 mln shares, just under 25 pct of the
  120.4 mln Progressive shares on issue.
      Progressive is currently involved in a proposed merger with
  &lt;Rainbow Corp Ltd>. Rainbow earlier this week raised its stake
  in Progressive to 52 pct. BIL opposes the Rainbow merger and
  analysts say BIL needs a 25 pct stake in Progressive to prevent
  it occurring.
      The merger involves shareholders in Progressive and Rainbow
  both receiving shares in a new company &lt;Astral Pacific Corp
  Ltd> on a one-for-one exchange basis.
      The BIL bid is higher than the 4.20 dlrs BIL said it would
  offer when it first announced on Monday it would make a full
  bid for Progressive, and it follows much public debate between
  BIL and Rainbow.
      BIL Chief Executive Paul Collins said last week that he
  opposes the Rainbow/Progressive merger because BIL sees
  Progressive shares as being worth twice as much as Rainbow's.
  BIL has not disclosed how many Progressive shares it holds.
      Rainbow has said the merger is soundly based. Chairman
  Allan Hawkins said last week that BIL's actions were aimed only
  at dirsrupting the merger and were not in the interests of
  Progressive shareholders.
      Both Rainbow's and Progressive's boards have approved the

  Schutz said. His expectations of a satisfactory profit were
  based on a combination of price rises and cost-cutting, he
  added.
      The expected drop in West German sales this year would be
  the result of the so-called ""grey market"" for Porsche cars, he
  said. When the dollar was strong against the mark, many
  Porsches had been bought locally in West Germany for illegal
  export to the U.S.
      Porsche has previously said domestic sales in the 1986/87
  first half fell to 3,267 from 5,387 in the same 1985/86 period.
      The fact that U.S. Sales will account for a larger
  percentage of overall sales this year than before does not pose
  problems for profit, the Porsche board said.
      In the last 12 months it has raised U.S. Prices by around
  20 pct without suffering any decline in sales. At the same time
  Porsche has hedged its dollar-denominated business for the
  1986/87 business year, finance director Heinz Branitzki.
      Branitzki put Porsche's hedging costs in 1985/86 at 28 mln
  marks.
      In a speech to the annual meeting, Schutz said third-party
  orders placed with Porsche's engineering research centre in
  Weissach were rising and should top 100 mln marks this year for
  the first time.
      Porsche's net profit dropped sharply to 75.3 mln marks in
  1985/86 from 120.4 mln marks in 1984/85.

165,1,"WESTINGHOUSE &lt;WX> SEES HIGHER EARNINGS GROWTH
  Westinghouse Electric Corp said
  earnings per share growth will exceed sales growth and will be
  in the double digit range through 1989.
      In 1986, the company earned 4.42 dlrs a share on revenues
  of 10.7 billion dlrs.
      Speaking at a meeting for securities analysts, Douglas
  Danforth, Westinghouse's chairman, said the company's sales
  growth target is about 8.5 pct a year for 1988 and 1989, ""given
  an economic environment that remains on a moderate growth
  course."" He also said the company will make acquisitions, but
  he did not specify particular targets.
      Paul E. Lego, senior executive vice president told the
  analysts ""our plans do not call for a multibillion dlr
  acquisition, even though our balance sheet can handle one.
  Despite this disclaimer, if we identify a major acquisition
  that has significnt value-creating for Westinghouse...we will
  consider it."" He said the company would consider an acquisition
  candidate that is in an area compatable with Westinghouse's
  primiary businesses.
      Danforth said the corportation was focused in several key
  areas including defense electronics, financial services,
  broadcasting, electrical products and services for construction
  and industrial and utility markets.
      Danforth added that he expects Westinghouse's sales to grow
  faster than the markets the corportation serves and ""surely
  faster than GNP.""
      He said earnings per share growth is expected to
  consistently exceed the Standard and Poor's 500 index and
  return on equity will remain in the 18 to 21 pct range.
      Leo W. Yochum, senior executive vice president for finance,
  told the analysts ""we will consider buying back stock"" but
  there are no current plans for such a buyback.
      Yochum said that at the company's current level of earnings
  it could comfortably maintain higher debt levels and that
  Westinghouse will use its debt capacity to improve shareholder
  value.
      Last year, Westinghouse established a 790 mln dlrs
  restructuring reserve to be used for plant consolodation,
  assett writedowns and other items. Yochum said, the company
  spent 306 mln dlrs of that reserve in 1986 and will spend 344
  mln dlrs of the reserves in 1987. The balance will be used in
  1988. He also said, capital expenditures should be about 400

  earnings after financial items of one billion crowns in 1987 vs

  at their present parities.
      Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion
  crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986, it said.
      A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct
  negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed
  on currency movements.
      Last year's results were also badly hit by a once-off
  writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets.
      The company said mainly this represented the premium the
  group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it
  had taken over.
      The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87
  billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly
  by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and
  partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln.
      Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it

  in LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-Intraocular

175,1,"GALACTIC &lt;GALCF> ADOPTS CONSERVATIVE ACCOUNTING
  Galactic Resources
  Ltd, earlier reporting a 1986 loss of 25.6 mln U.S. dlrs, said
  it adopted a more conservative accounting policy, similar to
  other gold producers' accounting for exploration costs.
      As a result, the company retroactively charged all past
  exploration and related administration costs incurred on its
  properties against expenses in 1986, 1985 and 1984.
      Under the new policy, all future exploration and related
  administration costs will be written off to expenses rather
  than capitalized as an intangible asset, it said.
      Galactic said the accounting change resulted in a 22.8 mln
  U.S. dlr charge against 1986 earnings. It did not immediately
  disclose the affect of the change on prior years' results.
      The new accounting policy is not expected to adversely
  affect working capital position, future cash flows or the
  company's ability to conduct ongoing business operations, it
  said.
      Galactic said the charge includes 9.9 mln U.S. dlrs of
  costs concerning its Summitville Mine leach pad and 8.9 mln
  U.S. dlrs in waste removal costs, dyke construction and other
  mine developments.
      Galactic said under the prior accounting policy, the
  Summitville mine expenses would have been amortized over the
  life of the mine and charged against future earnings.
      The change will also result in lower depreciation and
  amortization charges against income of about 52 U.S. dlrs an
  ounce of gold produced in future periods, based on total
  estimated reserves of 617,000 ounces.
      Galactic said March leaching production at Summitville is
  expected to exceed 2,500 ounces, raising gold equivalent
  production since the June 5, 1986 start of leaching to 65,000
  ounces.

  cash.
      Honeywell said it will use much of the money to reduce
  short-term debt incurred last December when the company
  purchased the Sperry Aerospace Group.
      Honeywell said the sale of HIS has created a new dedicated
  computer company jointly owned by Bull, NEC and Honeywell.
      The new privately held company, named Honeywell Bull, is
  42.5 pct owned by Honeywell Inc, 42.5 pct by Bull and 15 pct by
  NEC, the new company said.
      Honeywell added that terms of the agreement with NEC and
  Bull allow it to reduce its current 42.5 pct stake in the new
  company to 19.9 pct at the end of 1988 by selling just over
  half its shares to Bull. Book value at the time will determine
  the move's pricing, Honeywell said.
      Honeywell chairman and chief executive officer, Edson
  Spencer, said the move is the last major step in Honeywell's
  restructuring.
      ""As the leading worldwide supplier of of automation and
  controls for buildings, industry, aerospace and defense,
  Honeywell is now focusing its management, technical and
  financial resources on high market share business,"" Spencer
  said.
      Honeywell said it expects to be Honeywell Bull's largest
  customer, purchasing computers for its own internal data
  processing, for integration into Honeywell buidling and
  industrial automation systems and for resale to the U.S.
  governement.
      Honeywell said HIS's Federal Systems Division is now a
  wholly owned unit of Honeywell Inc, and has been named
  Honeywell Federal Systems Inc.
      Honeywell said it accounted for HIS as a discontinued
  operation in 1986, and will account for its future interest on
  a cost basis, recording any dividends as received.
      Honeywell Bull said it will continue to develop its product
  line and build its business in integrated systems for
  networking, database management and transaction processing.
      The new company said its board will have nine members,
  including the chairman and chief executive officer.
      Bull will have four members, Honeywell two and NEC one, the
  new company, which began worldwide operations today, said.
      It added that Jacques Stern, Bull's chairman and chief

  to improve profits over time.
      Honeywell Inc earlier today received 527 mln dlrs in cash
  for the sale of 57.5 pct of its computer business to Bull and
  NEC. Honeywell will retain a 42.5 pct interest in Honeywell
  Bull and Bull will own an equal amount.
      NEC owns 15 pct of the company.
      Meyer, who had been executive vice president of Honeywell
  Information Systems, said Honeywell Bull would work closely
  with NEC and Bull in both developing new products and marketing
  computers to multi-national companies.
      ""We haven't been growing as fast as we'd like, but we are
  going to turn that around,"" Meyer said. He said business was 
  soft in the U.S.
      He said the company was reorganizing its distribution

  employees. He also said the company was hiring new workers.
      Honeywell Bull chairman Jacques Stern, who is also chairman
  of Bull, said he believed the computer industry could be a fast
  growing market for companies that provide the type of computers
  customers want. ""I don't believe in the slump of the market,""
  he said.
      The computer company would offer open systems so that
  customers would not be tied to a specific vendor or

  larger acquisitions are possible if they are the right fit.

  with analysts' predictions of 4.80 dlrs to 5.30 dlrs a share
  this year. In 1986 the company earned 4.42 dlrs a share.

  McLean Industries Inc said its
  two shipping subsidiaries -- UNITED States Lines Inc and United
  States Lines (S.A.) Inc -- have agreed in principle to dispose
  of substantially all their remaining operating shipping assets.
      The units have been operating under protection of Chapter
  11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code since last November.
      McLean said U.S. Lines has a letter of intent with CSX
  Corp's &lt;CSX> Sea-Land Corp subsidiary to transfer assets of its
  Transpacific/Hawaii/Guam Service to Sea-Land.
      McLean said Sea-Land has tentatively agreed to pay 125 mln
  dlrs for six vessels, certain port facilities, and various
  other equipment used in U.S. Lines' Transpacific service and
  theree Lancer class vessels and subsidy rights owned by the two
  McLean subsidiaries.
      As previously announced, U.S. Lines (S.A.) will transfer
  its South American Service to &lt;Crowley Maritime Corp>'s
  American Transport Lines Inc subsidiary in return for a fixed
  lease payment for the four Lancer class vessels and a
  participation based on American Transport's South American
  revenues.
      McLean said the agreement also calls for Crowley to release
  U.S. Lines (S.A.) for any damages and unpaid charter hire for
  three vessels leased to U.S. Lines (S.A.) by Crowley which have
  been returned to Crowley.
      McLean said the minimum lease payments will be seven mln
  dlrs and estimated revenue participation during the first four
  years at about 16 mln dlrs. In addition, U.S. Lines (S.A.)
  subsidiaries in Brazil and Argentina will be sold to American
  Transport.
      The company said both agreements in principle have been
  approved by directors of the companies involved, but still need
  court, regulatory and lender approval.
      McLean said it is requesting the bankruptcy court to
  schedule a hearing on its motion to approve the agreements,
  adding that the court has granted the company's request to
  extend for 90 days the period for the shipping companies to
  file a proposed plan of reorganization.
      It said the planned transactions will leave McLean with no
  significant shipping assets except 12 New York class vessels,
  which are not in operation and are expected to be sold.
      McLean said its shipping units are returning the vessels
  operating in foreign commerce to United States ports to permit
  the planned transfer to purchasers.
      The company said U.S. Lines will maintain its weekly
  service from the U.S. West Coast to Hawaii and Guam until the
  vessels are transferred and the transaction is completed.

225,1,"BFG PARTIAL OPERATING PROFITS FALL SHARPLY IN 1986
  Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG
  &lt;BKFG.F>, BfG, partial operating profits fell to 182.6 mln
  marks in 1986 from 313.7 mln in 1985, new majority shareholder
  Aachener und Muenchener Beteiligungs-AG &lt;AMVG.F>, AMB, said.
      But total operating and extraordinary profits, including
  earnings from currency and securities trading on the bank's own
  account and earnings from the sale of holdings in other firms,
  were more than double the previous year's level, AMB said.
      BfG's 1986 accounts were included in a prospectus for AMB's
  capital increase, which is to finance the insurance company's
  acquisition of 50 pct plus one share of BfG.
      Despite the fall in partial operating profits, BfG paid an
  unchanged 20 mln marks into open reserves and transferred an
  unchanged 80 mln marks to its trade union holding company,
  &lt;Beteiligungsgesellschaft fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG>, from which
  AMB has acquired the majority stake.
      The bank has said its business last year suffered from the
  turbulence around the troubled trade-union-owned housing
  concern Neue Heimat.
      AMB said the 500 mln mark drop in BfG's business volume to
  50.1 billion marks affected the interest surplus.
      The interest surplus, which fell to 897.9 mln marks from
  981.1 mln, was also depressed by the 0.1 point fall in the
  interest margin to 1.9 pct.
      A rise in the surplus on commission to 208.8 mln marks from
  188.1 mln was not enough to compensate for this.
      The rise in total operating profits enabled BfG to step up
  risk provisions, with country risks particularly emphasised
  because of the continuing difficulties of some countries.
      Disclosed risk provisions, which under West German
  accounting rules do not necessarily reflect the full amount,
  rose to 736.3 mln marks from 224.0 mln.
      BfG's parent credit volume eased to 32.63 billion marks in
  1986 from 33.51 billion. Foreign debtors accounted for 24 pct
  of this credit volume, and Latin American debtors accounted for
  14.7 pct of total lending to foreigners.
      BfG posted extraordinary earnings from the sale of 25.01
  pct of &lt;Volksfuersorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG>, 74.9
  pct of &lt;BSV Bank fuer Sparanlagen und Vermoegensbildung AG> and
  five pct of &lt;Allgemeine Hypothekenbank AG>. The sale was linked
  to AMB's acquisition of a majority of BfG.
      These sales show up as 494.2 mln marks from profit transfer
  agreements and 326.5 mln from writing back risk provisions.

      Formal documents will be sent to shareholders as soon as

      BTR Nylex, which manufactures rubber and plastic products,
  first bid for BWA in late January.
      As previously reported, Borg-Warner Corp, which owns 65 pct
  of BWA's ordinary shares and 100 pct of the preferences,
  advised a month ago that it would not accept the offer.
      This meant BTR Nylex's 50.1 pct acceptance condition could
  not be met, BWA said in a statement reporting its parent's
  decision.
      BWA advised shareholders to ignore the offer and said other
  parties had expressed interest in bidding for it.

  An investor group trying to acquire
  GenCorp Inc said it would move to unseat the board of directors

  billion dlr takeover bid.
      General Acquisition Co, a partnership of Wagner and Brown
  and AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG>, reiterated in a statement sent to
  GenCorp on Friday that it was willing to negotiate its earlier
  offer of 100 dlrs a share for the tire, broadcasting, plastics
  and aerospace conglomerate.
      Analysts have speculated GenCorp could fetch at least 110
  to 120 dlrs per share if broken up.
      GenCorp officials declined to comment on the statement, but
  a spokesman reiterated a request to shareholders to wait until
  the board renders an opinion before making a decision on the
  offer. GenCorp has said a statement would be made on or before
  the company's annual meeting on Tuesday.
      General Acquisition said the board could not carry out its
  duties to shareholders and make an informed decision until it
  has, ""... Explored with us the ways in which our offer can be
  revised to provide greater value to your shareholders.""
      General Acquisition added it was aware the board may be
  reviewing alternative transactions, which might provide GenCorp
  shareholders with a payment other than cash.
      ""If that is the case, you should recognise that our
  additional equity capital may very well enable us to offer cash
  and securities having greater value than GenCorp could provide
  in any similarly structured transaction,"" it said.
      It added GenCorp's board had an obligation to present any
  alternative proposal to shareholders in a way that allowed
  competing offers.
      General Acquisition requested it be given a chance to bid
  on a competitive and fair basis before any final decision was
  made on any other buyout proposal.
      The statement repeated the request GenCorp remove a ""poison
  pill"" preferred share purchase rights to shareholders, making
  any takeover more expensive.
      It said it might take legal action, or seek the support of
  shareholders in calling a special meeting to replace the board
  and consider other proposals.
      GenCorp should not accept any other proposal containing
  defensive features, it said.

  Woolworth Holdings Plc &lt;WLUK.L> said it

  acquire a retail chemist chain. Earlier this year it negotiated
  a possible bid for &lt;Underwoods Plc> buit the talks were broken
  off two weeks ago.
      Full acceptance of the offer would involve the issue of
  about 29.8 mln new Woolworth shares, or 14 pct of the enlarged
  share capital. A cash alternative would offer 646p for each
  share in Superdrug. Members of the Goldstein family have

  The recent deterioration in the

  maintain efforts to reduce costs, the company said in a
  statement.
      It reported that its competitive position had weakened
  considerably in the second half of 1986, leading to a seven pct
  cut in steel output over the whole of the year to 3.74 mln
  tonnes.
      Arbed had managed to make a 890 mln franc net profit,
  slightly down from the 1.12 billion profit in 1985, thanks to
  lower raw material costs and prudent management, the company
  said.
      Arbed said the early months of 1987 had seen the market
  deteriorate further, but the decision of the European Community
  to maintain anti-crisis measures, at least provisionally,
  should under normal circumstances have a beneficial effect.
      EC ministers have agreed to extend a quota production
  system while discussions continue on an industry plan for
  capacity reductions.
      Arbed said in current conditions, cost cutting efforts
  remain necessary to avoid any weakening of resources which have

"
237,1,"BASF &lt;BASF.F> SAYS 1986 RESULTS AFFECTED BY DLR
  BASF AG said
  the volatile currency situation last year, particularly the
  fall of the dollar, led to sharp drops in turnover denominated
  in marks and to price reductions for exports from domestic
  production.
      But in a statement accompanying year-end figures, the group
  said it expected satisfactory business development over the
  next months. ""At the moment we do not expect any extraordinary
  influences such as there were last year,"" it said. Orders in
  hand and incoming orders were steady at a high level.
      BASF reported 13.6 pct lower 1986 world group pre-tax
  profit at 2.63 billion marks compared to 1985.
      The unusual situation on the crude oil market last year
  also produced a clear sales slide in the oil and gas sector and
  forced price declines for petrochemical products, BASF said.
      The fall in pre-tax profit corresponded to the losses on
  stocks in the oil and gas sector at the beginning of 1986. In
  the parent company, the positive earnings development
  continued, it said, where pre-tax profit rose by 3.2 pct to
  1.97 billion marks. The decline in parent company turnover was
  balanced out by increased capacity use and price declines in
  raw materials. 
      In 1986, world group turnover was off 8.8 pct at 40.47
  billion marks compared to 1985, BASF said. Parent turnover fell
  8.5 pct to 18.72 billion.
      Turnover increases, with the exceptions of the sectors fine
  chemicals and informations systems, had only been achieved in
  those areas widened last year through acquisition in 1985.
      Results from these had been taken only partly into the
  fourth quarter of that year but fully included in 1986 data.
      So far in the current year, the investment volume of the
  parent company and the world group is exceeding that in 1986,
  BASF said, without giving concrete figures.

  252.2 mln.
      The strong recovery of the first six months continued into
  the second half, although U.K. Cement demand rose only
  modestly. Results benefitted from cost cutting and higher
  volumes.
      The decision by the Cement Makers Federation to end the
  pricing agreement reflected pressure from higher competition
  due to growing imports and the possibility that the system
  would be taken to the Restrictive Practices Court by the U.K.

  Mannesmann AG &lt;MMWG.F> said it has

      The takeover is contingent on approval from the Federal
  Cartel Office in West Berlin, a spokesman said, adding that
  Mannesmann was confident the authorities would not block the
  purchase.
      Mannesmann is buying 75 pct of &lt;MEC Sachs
  Vermoegensholding> which owns 37.5 pct of Sachs AG, which in
  turn holds 96.5 pct of Fichtel und Sachs. The MEC shares will
  be bought from the granddaughters of the firm's founder.

  und Sachs from Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> and has an option to buy
  the bank's remaining 10 pct stake, a company statement said.
      In addition to these firm agreements, Mannesmann is also
  talking with the state-owned steel group Salzgitter AG
   &lt;SALG.H> on buying its 24.98 pct stake in Fichtel und Sachs.
   This would give Mannesmann around 75 pct of Fichtel und Sachs.
      Salzgitter said it decided to give up its own original
  plans to seek a majority stake in Sachs after holding talks
  with the government in Bonn.
      Earlier this month Mannesmann disclosed that it might want
  a majority stake in Sachs after previously saying it was
  seeking to buy only a minority holding in the company, which
  has annual turnover of 2.2 billion marks and employs 17,000.
      The acquisition is part of Mannesmann's efforts to
  diversify into high-technology areas and away from its previous
  reliance on steel and pipe-making. More
      A spokesman for the Federal Statistics Office later said
  the anti-cartel authorities would probably rule on the takeover

      General Acquisition also said it believes that GenCorp's
  board has an obligation to present any alternative transaction
  it may propose to shareholders in a manner that would allow for
  competing offers.
      The partnership requested that if any other proposal is
  under consideration that it be given the same information
  available to GenCorp's managers and advisers in constructing a
  proposal.
       General Acquisition said that if GenCorp agrees to accept
  another buyout proposal that it also be given an opportunity to
  bid on a competitive and fair basis before any final decision
  is made.
      General Acquisition repeated its request that GenCorp
  remove its ""poison pill"" or shareholders rights plan.
      General Acquisition said if GenCorp does not allow an
  ""environment for fair competition,"" it will take all steps
  necessary to create such an enviroment.
      It said it may take legal action or seek the support of
  shareholders in calling a special meeting to replace the board
  and to consider other proposals it might develop.
      General Acquisition also said if the board decides to
  accept an alternate proposal it asked that it not accept a plan
  that would include defensive features.

344,2,"AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF
  American Express Co remained silent on
  market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson
  Lehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be
  considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market
  value of its stock.
      American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the
  market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a
  good market value, thereby boosting the total value of American
  Express. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial
  services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.
      American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at
  72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.
      American Express would not comment on the rumors or its
  stock activity.
      Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts'
  meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement
  yesterday of management changes.
      At the meeting, company officials said American Express
  stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance
  of Shearson, according to analysts.
      Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief
  operating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of
  president, which had been vacant. It also created four new
  positions for chairmen of its operating divisions.
      Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most
  sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total
  spinoff.
      Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of
  Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for
  American Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last
  year.
      ""I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is
  going to sell shearson,"" said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical.
  He questioned what would be a better investment than ""a very
  profitable securities firm.""
      Several analysts said American Express is not in need of
  cash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong
  asset.
      But others believe the company could very well of
  considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one
  rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.
      Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he
  believes American Express could have considered a partial
  spinoff in the past.
      ""Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a
  big premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is in
  the 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would
  probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market
  capitalization,"" said Eckenfelder.
      Some analysts said American Express could use capital since
  it plans to expand globally.
      ""They have enormous internal growth plans that takes
  capital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to
  enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the
  road,"" said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.
      ""They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily
  in the future, which goes heavily into the international
  arena,"" said Lewis. ""...That does not preclude acquisitions and
  divestitures along the way,"" he said.
      Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the
  brokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might
  better reflect other assets, such as the travel related
  services business.
      ""It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure
  to brokerage. The value of the other components could command a
  higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of
  the total operating earnings of the company,"" he said.
       Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax
  operating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985.

  A group led by members of the

  taking part in a move to take control of the company.
      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  the group said it has had discussions with other Taft
  stockholders and some company managers and directors
  ""concerning participation in a group to acquire control"" of the
  company.
      The Bass group, which did not identify any of the other
  people with whom it said it has had talks, said it plans to
  continue evaluating Taft and ""will be involved in further
  discussions relating to the future control and direction"" of
  the company.
      The group, which holds 2,291,210 Taft common shares, said
  its members may buy more shares of Taft common stock, or may
  decide to sell some or all of its stake.
      On Friday Taft said it would negotiate with a group led by
  its vice chairman, Dudley Taft, and a Rhode Island investment

  The Bass Group, once thought by
  analysts to be eager to sell its holdings in Taft Broadcasting
  Co, emerged as another potential bidder for the Ohio
  broadcasting company.
      The Bass Group, which holds 24.9 pct of Taft, said it had
  talked with other taft stockholders and some company managers
  and directors ""concerning participation in a group to acquire
  control"" of the company.
      The Bass group said it had talks with other Taft
  stockholders and members of Taft management about participating
  in a group to acquire control. The group, which is led by the
  wealthy bass brothers of Fort Worth, Texas, did not identify
  any of the other people with whom it had talks.
      Taft said Friday it would negotiate with its vice Chairman
  Dudley Taft on his group's 150 dlr per share or 1.38 billion
  dlr offer for the company.
      At the time, the company said it authorized its adviser,
  Goldman, Sachs and Co, to explore other takeover proposals and
  to supply financial data to other interested bidders.
      ""If indeed, the reason Dudley Taft is no longer president
  is because the bass group tossed him out, I couldn't see them
  backing him on any deal,"" said one analyst, who asked not to be
  identified.
      ""I think they wanted a way out. Now, this sounds like
  they're going to join the group and buy themselves out,"" said
  Edward Atorino, media analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham
  and Co.
      Analysts have speculated that Carl Lindner may be
  interested in acquiring the company. they speculated he may be
  one of the shareholders in talks with the bass group.
      Lindner, chairman of American Financial Corp, holds 16.2
  pct of Taft. He was not immediately available for comment.
      Analysts have said they are baffled by the strength of
  Taft's stock price compared to what they see as breakup values
  for the company.
      Several analysts had estimated a break up value of less
  than 150. One analyst said he believes it has a breakup value
  of 160 to 165 dlrs per share.
      Taft stock closed at 156-1/2, up 1-3/4.

383,2,"U.S. DOT APPROVES AMERICAN &lt;AMR>-ACI &lt;ACF> PACT
  The U.S. Department of
  Transportation (DOT) said it gave final clearance to the
  proposed 225 mln dlr acquisition of AirCal Inc by American
  Airlines Inc.
      ""The acquisition is not likely to substantially lessen
  competition or to be inconsistent with the public interest,"" the
  DOT said in a statement.
      AirCal is a unit of ACI Holdings Inc while American is a
  unit of AMR Corp.
      The DOT had given tentative approval to the merger plan
  Feb. 20.
      American is the third largest U.S. airline in terms of
  revenue passenger miles while AirCal--a relatively small
  carrier that primarily serves West Coast cities--is the
  nation's 17th largest passenger carrier. Their merger would not
  alter American's third-place ranking, according to data
  compiled by Aviation Daily, a leading industry trade magazine.
      The combination would incrase American's share of the U.S.
  market to 15.4 pct from its current 14.7 pct, the DOT said.
      The DOT said the merger was unlikely to substantially
  reduce competition on the four routes on which both carriers
  provide either nonstop or single-plane service.
      At 13 of the 14 terminals served by both carriers, the DOT
  said it found no evidence that other carriers could not
  increase or begin service that competed with a merged
  American-AirCal.
      Concerning the 14th, ""While entry may not be possible at the
  Orange County Airport in the near future, DOT found that the
  service provided at other airports in the Los Angeles area,
  especially at the Los Angeles International Airport, will
  provide effective competition for Orange County travelers in
  long-haul markets,"" the DOT said.
      The merger would give American control of 37 pct of the
  authorized takeoff and landing slots at the Orange County
  terminal, where environmental concerns and a small terminal
  building limit future opportunities for expansion.
      The DOT said the Air Line Pilots Association filed comments
  opposing the merger but ""raised no new facts or arguments.""
      Under the merger terms, announced Nov. 17, American will
  pay 15 dlrs a share for the outstanding stock of ACI Holdings.

392,1,"CANADA BANKS COULD SEE PRESSURE ON BRAZIL LOANS
  Canada's major banks will likely face
  stiff pressure to declare their Brazilian loans non-performing
  if, as expected, major U.S. banks take similar action after the
  end of their first quarter tomorrow, analysts said.
      American bankers said last week that slow progress in debt
  talks with Brazil increased the likelihood that U.S. banks
  would soon declare their Brazilian loans non-performing.
      Such action ""would put a lot of pressure on the Canadian
  banks to do the same,"" Levesque, Beaubien Inc Toronto-based bank
  analyst Donna Pulcine told Reuters.
      ""They (banks) like to appear to be conservative,"" said
  Pulcine, ""and if a major bank puts loans on a non-performing
  basis and the Canadian banks don't, there is going to be a lot
  of pressure from shareholders as to why one bank is considering
  the loans non-performing and another bank is not.""
      Wood Gundy Inc bank analyst Patricia Meredith said any
  willingness by a major Brazilian bank creditor such as Citicorp
  &lt;CCI> to declare its Brazilian loans non-performing rather than
  let Brazil dictate settlement terms would provide a compelling
  example for other creditor banks.
      ""In order to make that strategy work, they (Citicorp) have
  to have the support of the other banks,"" said Meredith.
      Bank analyst Michael Walsh at First Marathon Securities Ltd
  said at least one Canadian bank, which he declined to identify,
  ""wants to put (the Brazilian loans) on a non-performing basis
  and is trying to encourage the others to take that position.""
      Canadian banks are owed about seven billion Canadian dlrs
  by Brazil, which late last month suspended interest payments on
  its 68 billion U.S. dlr foreign bank debt.
      Banks in Canada, although allowed to wait up to 180 days
  before declaring loans on which they are receiving no interest
  as non-performing, usually move on such loans within 90 days.
  They could therefore delay action on the Brazilian loans until
  late May, which falls in Canadian banks' third quarter ending
  July 31.
      &lt;Bank of Montreal>, Brazil's largest Canadian bank
  creditor, said last week it was not currently considering
  declaring its 1.98 billion dlrs of Brazilian loans as
  non-performing.
      ""I think that is just for the benefit of the public,"" Walsh
  said of Bank of Montreal's statement. 
      Some analysts predicted minimal earnings impact on Canadian
  banks from a move to declare the Brazilian loans
  non-performing.
      They said Brazil would likely resume interest payments by
  the banks' fiscal year-end on October 31, thus allowing banks
  to recoup their lost interest income.
      ""From what Brazil has said, it is quite likely the banks
  will get the money,"" said Meredith. ""My outlook at this point is
  optimistic that there will be no adjustment for the full-year's
  earnings.""
      Meredith forecast 1987 fully diluted per share earnings of
  3.80 dlrs for &lt;Royal Bank of Canada> compared with 3.74 in
  1986; 4.30 dlrs for &lt;Bank of Montreal> compared with 3.59; 2.25
  dlrs for &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce> compared with
  2.23;  2.15 dlrs for &lt;Bank of Nova Scotia> compared with 1.94,
  and 2.85 dlrs for &lt;Toronto Dominion Bank> against 2.74.
      She forecast 1.90 dlrs for &lt;National Bank of Canada>
  against 3.30 dlrs before a two for one stock split.
      Analyst Pulcine said she might lower full-year earnings
  estimates for the banks by between two cts and 10 cts a share,
  assuming a possible settlement reduced Brazil's interest costs.
      ""If the banks didn't receive anything for the rest of the
  fiscal year, the impact could range from 16 cts to 70 cts a
  share. But I don't see that as a likely scenario,"" Pulcine said.
      Walsh at First Marathon suggested, however, that the
  Brazilian debt situation was so complex that ""it could drag on
  beyond one full fiscal year.""
      He said he foresaw having to lower his 1987 fiscal earnings
  forecasts for the banks. He estimated that Brazil's yearly
  interest payments to Canadian banks totaled about 575 mln dlrs
  or about 10 pct of their total 1986 pre-tax earnings.

      The investments will go to plant expansion, infrastructure

      Among the best performers was steel company Sidor which
  earned 1.019 billion bolivars, the first time since 1978 Sidor

  Gencorp Inc said its board urged

  affiliate of Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries INc.
      Gencorp also said it is developing a financially superior
  alternative that would enable shareholders to benefit from the
  full value of the company.
      In a letter to shareholders, Chairman A. William Reynolds 
  said the offer is a ""highly conditional, contingently financed
  bust-up offer"" that seeks to deny shareholders the true value
  of their investment in Gencorp.
      Reynolds said the board reached its decision to reject the
  offer after careful study with legal and financial advisers. He
  said the board has authorized management to explore
  alternatives aimed at providing shareholders with a
  ""financially superior"" alternative to the general acquisition
  offer.
      A Gencorp spokesman, in response to questions, would not
  comment on market speculation that the company's management may
  develop a leveraged buyout offer of its own. He would also not
  comment on when a better alternative might be developed.
      Gencorp's stock has traded well above the 100 dlr offer
  price since the tender was made. Today, Gencorp closed at
  114-1/4, up 1-5/8.
      Reynolds said in the letter that for the last few years,
  Gencorp management has taken action to enhance shareholder
  value, and the stock price and earnings have improved since he
  joined the company.
      Gencorp said the partnership's offer is a ""bargain price""
  acquisition that was ""using financing from a syndicate of banks
  that does not yet exist and a bridge loan from Shearson Lehman
  brothers that shearson is not obligated to provide.""
      Reynolds also said the offer would result in a radical
  alteration and selloff of Gencorp's assets, including Aerojet
  General to refinance General Acquisition's borrowings with the
  profits going to Wagner and Brown and AFG instead of
  shareholders.
      The letter also said the General Acquisition offer
  ""jeopardizes the security and interests"" of its shareholders,
  employees, customers, suppliers and the communities throughout
  the country where the company's facilities are located.

  General Acquisition Co said it was

      Gencorp earlier urged shareholders to reject a 100 dlr per
  share tender offer from the partnership, which includes Wagner

  studying financially superior alternatives.
     The partnership called the response inflammatory and
  unproductive, particularly since it had attempted to discuss
  the offer with Gencorp.
       The partnership said Gencorp failed to say how it would
  provide a ""superior value yet they continue their attempt to
  prevent a satisfactory offer by failing to redeem their poison

  takeovers more expensive.
      Gencorp said in its statement earlier that the date its

411,1,"WOODSIDE SAYS LOSS REFLECTS LOWER OIL PRICES
  Woodside Petroleum Ltd &lt;WPLA.S> said
  its 1986 net loss largely reflected the drop in oil prices
  combined with a large tax provision.
      Woodside earlier reported attributable net loss rose to
  17.14 mln dlrs in 1986 from 8.73 mln in 1985, although group
  revenue rose to 220.84 mln from 173.50 mln.
      It said it should have received a 1.7 mln dlr tax credit
  but instead made a 10.04 mln dlr tax provision. This largely
  related to its &lt;Vamgas Ltd> unit, non-allowable exchange losses
  and tax benefits from the North-West Shelf project not
  recognised in the accounts.
      Woodside said the rise in revenue largely reflected full
  year sales of gas and condensate from the domestic phase of the
  Shelf project, against six month sales in 1985.
      Offsetting this was a 23 pct fall in the Cooper Basin gas
  and liquids revenue of its 50.6 pct-owned Vamgas unit.
      Since the balance date Woodside has accepted a Santos Ltd
  &lt;STOS.S> takeover offer for Vamgas.
      Woodside said a 92.8 mln dlr capital profit on the sale
  would be included in the 1987 accounts.
      It said it lifted capital spending on fixed assets to 269.6
  mln dlrs from 178.3 mln, mostly on the Shelf project.

412,2,"CSR SELLING DELHI TO EXXON UNIT, DROPS DELHI FLOAT
  CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> and Exxon Corp &lt;XON>
  unit &lt;Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc> said CSR
  has agreed to sell its &lt;Delhi Australia Fund> (DAF) to Esso for
  985 mln Australian dlrs.
      The sale is effective from tomorrow, they said in a joint
  statement.
      The previously announced float of part of its Delhi
  interest will not now proceed, CSR said in the statement.
      Delhi Australia Fund owns &lt;Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd>, which
  holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>-led
  Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects.
      In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equally
  in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate
  prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi's
  interests in the next two years, the statement said.
      ""The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will
  be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the
  float,"" CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement.
      Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus
  efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building
  materials in which CSR has had long and successful management
  experience and strong market leadership.
      With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businesses
  more aggressively and earlier, he said.
      As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhi
  sale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of &lt;Pioneer
  Sugar Mills Ltd> that it does not already hold, valuing its
  entire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs.
      After Bass Strait, the onshore Cooper and Eromanga Basin is
  Australia's largest oil and gas producing area with current
  gross oil production of 45,000 barrels per day (BDP), gas
  liquids output of 30,000 BPD and gas sales of 480 mln cubic
  feet a day, the CSR-Esso statement said.
      The purchase gives Esso, a 50/50 partner with The Broken
  Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S> in the Bass Strait, its first onshore
  production in Australia, they said.
      Esso's chairman Stuart McGill said he hoped Esso can assist
  in maintaining the high rate of oil and gas discoveries in the
  Cooper-Eromanga area.
      ""These discoveries will help Australia's self-sufficiency in
  oil reserves thereby offsetting in part the decline in Bass
  Strait production now under way,"" McGill said.
      In a separately released letter to CSR shareholders, Kelman
  said CSR was within days of completing plans for the float of
  CSR Petroleum when it received an offer from Esso.
      He said CSR is convinced the sale was the correct decision
  in view of the risks associated with the oil business.
      The price-sharing arrangement provides for CSR to share
  equally with Esso in higher returns if oil prices average more
  than 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years, he said.
      Kelman said a revaluation of CSR's investment in Delhi to
  net realisable value as of today, CSR's annual balance-date,
  will result in an extraordinary loss of 97 mln dlrs.
      However, revaluations and profits on sales of other assets
  will significantly reduce this loss, he said.
      He also said that CSR is sufficiently encouraged by future
  prospects and the opportunity to reposition the group in core
  businesses to foreshadow an increase in final dividend payable
  in July to 10 cents from nine to make an annual 19 cents
  against 18 in 1985/86.

      It added in a statement that parent net profit rose to
  288.2 mln marks in 1986 from 221.7 mln the prior year.
      A Commerzbank spokesman noted the figures were,however,
  preliminary and required approval of the bank's supervisory

      The Commerzbank statement added the distributable profit
  last year rose to 228.2 mln marks from 161.7 mln in 1985.
      With inclusion of the corporate tax allowance, qualifying
  domestic shareholders would receive an effective dividend of
  14.06 marks per share.
      Total dividend payout would rise to 186.8 mln marks from
  142.0 mln on 1985 earnings due to the increase in the dividend
  and in equity capital, it added.
      From the parent net profit, 60 mln marks would be placed in
  published reserves, unchanged from the two prior years.
      The shareholders' meeting take place on May 22 in Hamburg.
      The statement said holders of Commerzbank participation
  certificates in a total nominal value of 425 mln marks would
  receive the remaining 41.4 mln marks of the distributable
  profit. Aside from the basic payment of 8.25 pct of nominal
  value, certificate holders would receive an additional 1.5 pct.
      The management board of the bank would also propose two
  capital measures to shareholders in order to be able to react
  quickly to new challenges.
      It would ask for authorised capital of a nominal 200 mln

422,2,"ANALYSTS APPLAUD CSR'S BOLD MOVE TO SELL DELHI
  CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> has made a bold move in
  selling its oil and gas interests for almost a billion dlrs and
  ploughing 150 mln into its traditional sugar business, share
  analysts said.
      ""It sounds like a good deal,"" Stuart McKibbin of &lt;A.C. Goode
  and Co> told Reuters.
      CSR said it had dropped plans to float its oil and gas
  interests held in the &lt;Delhi Australia Fund> and would instead
  sell it to Exxon Corp &lt;XON> unit &lt;Esso Exploration and
  Production Australia Inc> for 985 mln dlrs.
      In a twin announcement CSR, already Australia's largest
  sugar refiner, made a 2.20 dlr a share bid for the 70 pct it
  does not already hold in &lt;Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd>.
      ""This will be a big shock to the market, which was under the
  impression that CSR was well down the road to floating Delhi,""
  McKibbin said.
      A float of part of Delhi would have raised between 200 and
  300 mln dlrs, but in opting to sell outright, CSR had given
  itself the cash to practically eliminate its debt and embark on
  an ambitious expansion programme in its best-performing
  divisions of sugar and building products, analysts said.
      CSR not only gets the 985 mln dlrs but also has the right
  to share equally with Esso any higher returns resulting from an
  oil price over 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years.
      Delhi is one of Australia's largest onshore oil producers
  yielding about six mln barrels a year from the Cooper Basin.
  Analysts said the deal could net CSR as much as three mln dlrs
  for every dollar rise in the oil price above 20 dlrs.
      Neale Goldston-Morris of Sydney broker &lt;Bain and Co Ltd>
  said the move out of Delhi and investment in the sugar industry
  was a sensible one but added that it represented the loss of
  Australian-owned assets to a foreign company.
      ""The farm they bought back a few years ago is being sold
  back to the Americans,"" Goldston-Morris said.
      The Pioneer Sugar investment would make CSR by far the
  largest player in Australia's 850 mln dlr a year sugar industry
  and would give it access to some of the best sugar properties
  and mills in the country, analysts said.
      They said Pioneer Sugar was expected to recommend
  acceptance of the bid through which CSR would benefit from the
  bottom out of a cyclical downturn in sugar prices.
      Sugar prices are forecast to rise to 340 dlrs a tonne next
  season from an estimated 270 dlrs this year, they said.
      Selling Delhi meant CSR has finally quit a damaging
  investment, made in 1981, which has dragged down the company's
  overall performance, analysts said.
      CSR last year wrote off more than 550 mln dlrs in losses on
  what had been a 591 mln U.S. Dlr investment financed entirely
  from U.S. Dollar debt, they said.
      ""It was a bad investment for them. They financed it entirely
  with debt, the currency collapsed on them and then the oil
  price collapsed on them,"" Owen Evans of Sydney broker &lt;Meares
  and Philips Ltd> said.
      Esso not only picked up Delhi's oil and gas output but also
  gained as much as 300 mln dlrs in transferable tax losses
  accumulated in exploration allowances and other concessions.
      Analysts said Esso also gained its first real onshore stake
  in Australia in its first major diversification from the 50/50
  Bass Strait partnership with The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd
  &lt;BRKN.S>.
      ""Esso has been very keen to diversify from the Gippsland
  Basin. They haven't found too much oil in Bass Strait lately
  and Esso needed a large pool of ongoing production,""
  Goldston-Morris said.

  equivalent, a group record. Reserves have increased every year
  since 1983 at a compounded rate of 10 pct a year.
      The company reported a 1986 pretax profit of 4.4 mln stg,
  down from 118 mln in 1985.
      It said falling oil prices caused the downturn.
      The company said it reacted swiftly to the sharp drop in
  oil prices which began over a year ago. Capital expenditure,
  which had been budgeted at over 150 mln stg, was cut to 51 mln
  stg net of disposals. Managers responded well to the demand for
  lower operating costs and this has been achieved worldwide.

      The sale is effective from tomorrow, they said in a joint
  statement.
      The previously announced float of part of its Delhi
  interest will not now proceed, CSR said in the statement.
      Delhi Australia Fund owns &lt;Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd>, which
  holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>-led
  Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects.
      In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equally
  in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate
  prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi's
  interests in the next two years, the statement said.
      ""The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will
  be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the
  float,"" CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement.
      Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus
  efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building
  materials in which CSR has had long and successful management
  experience and strong market leadership.
      With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businesses
  more aggressively and earlier, he said.
      As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhi
  sale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of &lt;Pioneer
  Sugar Mills Ltd> that it does not already hold, valuing its
  entire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs.

  CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> said it will offer 2.20
  dlrs cash each for the shares it does not already hold in
  &lt;Pioneer Sugar Mills Ltd>.
      CSR already holds 31.74 pct of Pioneer's 99.80 mln issued
  shares, it said in a statement.
      The offer price values the entire Pioneer Sugar share
  capital at 219.6 mln dlrs and compares with today's closing
  market level of 1.85 dlrs a share.
      CSR said it will announce further details of the offer
  soon, including an alternative offer of CSR shares for Pioneer
  Sugar stock.
      It said the offer is generous since it will give Pioneer
  Sugar shareholders a price equivalent to 29 times Pioneer's net
  earnings last financial year and a premium of 22 pct over
  yesterday's market price which CSR said it believed already
  contained an element of takeover speculation.
      It also gives a premium of 91 pct over Pioneer's last
  reported net tangible assets per share, CSR said.
      CSR said the generous offer price reflects the cost savings
  which will flow from integrated management of CSR's and
  Pioneer's raw sugar mills and building materials businesses.
      These economies can only be achieved through CSR control
  and management of Pioneer Sugar, it added.
      The takeover announcement came soon after CSR's earlier
  reported statement that it will sell its &lt;Delhi Petroleum Pty
  Ltd> unit to an Exxon Corp &lt;XON> unit for 985 mln dlrs and not
  proceed with the previously announced float of part of Delhi.

  Managing Director Hugh Fletcher said he was disappointed that
  &lt;Rada Corp Ltd> had decided to sell its shares in &lt;N.Z. Forest
  Products Ltd> (NZFP) to Australia's &lt;Amcor Ltd>.
      He said in a statement that FCL had made an offer for the
  24 pct of NZFP held by Rada. He said the FCL offer was better
  than Amcor's because it would have been made to all NZFP
  shareholders, but he gave no further details.
      Amcor and NZFP said earlier today they were merging their
  pulp and paper interests in a joint partnership and were
  increasing their existing cross-shareholdings.
      The plan involves NZFP increasing its current holding in
  Amcor to about 20 pct from four pct. Amcor will acquire Rada's
  NZFP stake to add to its existing 11 pct and will seek
  statutory approval to increase its holding to 50 pct.
      Rada bought its stake for 505.5 mln dlrs from &lt;Wattie
  Industries Ltd> last year, but it has not disclosed the price
  to be paid by Amcor.
      FCL originally launched a takeover bid for NZFP late last
  year with a scrip and/or cash offer at 3.90 dlrs a share,
  valuing the company at 1.3 billion dlrs. NZFP shares ended at
  3.88 dlrs today.

435,1,"MANNESMANN SEES DIFFICULT YEAR FOR CAPITAL GOODS
  Mannesmann AG &lt;MMWG.F> expects a
  difficult year for the capital goods industry in 1987, chief
  executive Werner Dieter told a news conference.
      Dieter said West German producers would see a downturn in
  foreign business because of lower energy prices and the higher
  mark, as well as a deterioration of the economies of customer
  nations.
      Domestic business was also declining and orders for West
  German engineering goods have been falling since July 1986,
  Dieter said.
      Mannesmann's profit fell by an undisclosed amount in 1986.
      Dieter said Mannesmann's pipe activities would suffer a
  set- back, although measures to cut costs, which were started
  last year, were now having an effect.
      Dieter noted, however, that pipes and related products
  accounted for less than 30 pct of Mannesmann's turnover. The
  company saw good chances in the automation sector, which Dieter
  said had become one of Mannesmann's ""strategic aims.""
      He said the company's drive to combine activities in
  mechanical and electronic engineering was a particular ""plus
  point"" for Mannesmann.
      Mannesmann, which yesterday announced it had agreed to take
  a majority stake in the Fichtel und Sachs AG car parts group
  for an undisclosed sum, saw third party group turnover fall
  nine pct in 1986 to 16.60 billion marks. Its world group net
  profit in 1985 was 255.9 mln marks.
      It has blamed the fall in 1986 profits on the weaker dollar
  and lack of demand for steel pipe.
      Dieter said there were signs that prices for steel pipe
  were bottoming out and would slowly start to rise, but he added
  the company would continue to cut personnel in this sector this
  year.

  loss for the financial year ending last October, compared with
  a record pre-tax profit of 21.7 mln stg in 1985, chairman Sir
  Adam Thomson told reporters.
      A decline in U.S. Transatlantic traffic following terrorist
  attacks in Europe, the U.S. Bombing of the Libya, the Chernobyl
  disaster and a slump in the oil industry which affected Middle
  East traffic were the main causes of the loss, Thomson said.
      He said the poor results were caused by ""a range of
  exceptional circumstances wholly outside our direct control"" and
  predicted a return to profitability this year.
      Last year, the airline was forced to axe 1,000 jobs, sell
  some of its assets and cut the number of its flights across the
  Atlantic and to the Middle East following the fall in business

  General Acquisition Co said it was

      Gencorp had earlier urged shareholders to reject a 100 dlr
  per share tender offer from General Acquisition, an affiliate
  of Wagner and Brown and AFG Industries Inc, and said it was
  studying financially superior alternatives.
      The General Acquisition partnership called the response
  inflammatory and unproductive, particularly since it had tried
  to discuss the offer with Gencorp.
      The partnership said Gencorp failed to say how it would
  provide a ""superior value yet they continue their attempt to
  prevent a satisfactory offer by failing to redeem their poison
  pill."" Poison pills are shareholder rights plans that make
  takeovers more expensive.
      Gencorp said in its statement earlier that it planned to
  put off the date its rights will trade separately from the
  common stock to April 6 from April 3. It said the extension was
  subject to further extensions by the board and is conditional
  on no person acquiring beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more
  of Gencorp before April 6.
      General Acquisition said it is confident its offer can be

  &lt;Gruppo Ferruzzi> is studying a
  project which could result in a public share offer of up to 49
  pct of its French unit &lt;European Sugar (France)> and could
  raise around 400 mln dlrs, Ferruzzi chairman Raul Gardini said.
      Gardini told Reuters the operation under consideration was
  aimed at ""international markets"" and that the figure of 400 mln
  dlrs given in some press reports ""was probably about right.""
      European Sugar, wholly-owned by Ferruzzi unit Eridania
  Zuccherifici Nazionali SpA &lt;ERDI.M>, is expected to absorb the
  European corn wet milling business of CPC International Inc
  &lt;CPC.N> which Ferruzzi recently agreed to buy.
      Ferruzzi announced last week it had agreed in principle to
  buy the CPC operation for 630 mln dlrs.
      A Ferruzzi spokesman later confirmed that the group was
  studying the transfer of the CPC business to European Sugar
  along with a possible share offering in the Paris unit, but
  gave no details.
      The flotation plan has been interpreted by financial
  analysts as a means of helping finance the acquisition of the
  CPC business.
      In London yesterday, chairman of Belgian starch producer
  &lt;Amylum NV> Pierre Callebaut told Reuters that since Ferruzzi
  was ""apparently still organising finance,"" his company might
  still succeed with its rival bid for the CPC business.
      Gardini, commenting on Callebaut's remarks, said the 630
  mln dlrs agreed for the CPC acquisition would be paid ""at the
  date foreseen in the preliminary contract.""
      Gardini could not reveal the date in question nor give any
  indication of the likely timing of an offering of shares in
  European Sugar, but it was announced last week that Ferruzzi's
  purchase of the CPC business was expected to be completed by
  September 30.
      Callebaut said yesterday that Amylum was surprised and
  disappointed that its 675 mln dlr bid cash offer for CPC's
  European business was apparently rejected in favour of
  Ferruzzi's lower bid.
      Gardini, commenting on Callebaut's remarks, said ""Amylum
  should know that one succeeds in a bid by making the right
  offer at the right moment - exactly as Ferruzzi did in the case
  of the acquisition of CPC's European business.""
      Gardini said it was not Callebaut's business to concern
  himself with the European Sugar capital raising operation under
  study, he added.
      Asked about press reports that Ferruzzi might follow up the
  European Sugar flotation with the sale of 49 pct of the CPC
  business, Gardini said: ""We do not exclude having minority
  partners in the CPC business."" He declined to elaborate.

      Last week, GAF increased its ownership of Borg-Warner

  its 12.4 pct holding.
      GAF emphasized ""the amicable nature of the proposed
  transaction,"" which it characterized as a partnership.
      GAF said it wanted to discuss with the Borg-Warner board 
  key roles for Borg-Warner's senior management in the new

465,2,"AKZO PLANNING US INVESTMENTS
  Dutch chemicals group Akzo
  NV &lt;AKZO.AS> said it hoped to consolidate its core activities
  this year by making small acquisitions in the US.
     Akzo chairman Aarnoud Loudon told a news conference on its
  1986 report that the company wanted to achieve the same level
  of US investments it had before it divested its fibre firm
  American Enka in December 1985, when US investments represented
  20 pct of Akzo's total capital.
     The US expansion plans were not an attempt to compensate for
  losses in guilder income through the lower dollar, Loudon said.
      He said a more important factor was the speed of growth in
  the US, adding ""It's the largest industrial market in the world.""
  But he said the company would also be looking at possible
  acquisitions in Europe.
      Despite its highly liquid cash flow, Akzo did not plan
  acquisitions on a scale that would negatively influence the
  company's debt/equity ratio, Loudon said.
     The chairman said in the past two years Akzo had spent 1.1
  billion guilders on acquisitions, of which nearly two thirds
  were in the United States.

  Gruppo Ferruzzi is studying a

      European Sugar, wholly-owned by Ferruzzi unit Eridania

  Keycorp said it has signed a

  Commercial Securities share.
      Keycorp said this gives the transaction an indicated value
  of 102 mln dlrs.
      Keycorp said the amount of its stock to be exchanged will
  be based on the daily average closing price of the shares for
  an unspecified period prior to the closing of the acquisition.
      Based on a maximum of about 2.75 Keycorp shares and a
  minimum of about 1.8 Keycorp to be exchanged, the agreement
  provides that if the average price of Keycorp common is less
  than 21.50 dlrs a share during the pricing period, the
  agreement will terminate unless a new conversion ratio can be
  negotiated.
      Keycorp said the transaction is designed to be tax free to
  Commercial Security shareholders. The company said it will
  treat the merger as a pooling of interests.
      It said the proposal is subject to approval by Commercial
  Security shareholders and various regulators.
      Keycorp said the merger is expected to become effective as
  soon as possible after December 31, 1987, the date Utah's
  interstate banking law becomes operational.
      Keycorp said Richard K. Hemingway and certain members of

  Exxon Corp said that 1986's 15 pct
  increase in earnings per share to 7.42 dlrs a share were
  partially based on its streamlined operations which compensated
  for the weakness in its exploration earnings and the lowest
  crude oil prices in a decade.
      Exxon said economies introduced in its operations from
  reductions in personnel and other savings, such as reductions
  in exploration expenses, were reflected in an 880 mln dlr
  reduction in consolidated operating costs from 1985.
      The company said its more efficient operations would be
  necessary to offset more adverse oil market conditions ahead.
      The company also said that its share repurchase plan
  contributed to the per share gains over 1985.
      In a breakdown of costs, Exxon said that operating expenses
  slipped to 9.2 billion dlrs in 1986 from 9.7 billion dlrs the
  previous year and exploration expenses, including dry holes,
  slipped back to 1.2 billion dlrs from 1.5 billion dlrs over the
  same period as the number of wells drilled was lower.
      The company was also able to use lower interest rates to
  reduce its interest expenses to 614 mln dlrs in 1986 from 627
  mln dlrs the previous year.
      Exxon said that the ratio of debt to capital was cut by 1.6
  pct in 1986 from the previous year to 19 pct.
      On December 31, 1986 Exxon's total debt of 7.87 billion
  dlrs was down slightly from the previous year's 7.9 billion
  dlrs and long term debt stood at 4.3 billion dlrs, down from
  4.8 billion dlrs in 1985.
      Exxon's policy of repurchasing shares on the market for its

      Arvin said it might earn 57 cts to 60 cts a share in the
  quarter.
      These results also reflect the seasonally low sales pattern
  of automotive replacement parts in that period.
      Arvin forecast about 85 cts a share net in the second

      The company said revenues for full year 1987 it will exceed
  1.4 billion dlrs, net earnings will increase more than 30 pct,
  while per share earnings should increase 12 to 18 pct.
      Arvin's 1986 revenues were 995.6 mln, net reached 41.2 mln
  and earnings per share 2.46 dlrs.
      It based these forecasts due to the addition of Schrader

528,1,"CANADA'S AIRLINE PROFITS SEEN HIGHER
  Canada's airline industry, shaken up by
  a recent merger that creates a powerful new competitor for
  government-owned Air Canada, has begun its first serious drive
  for profitability in 50 years, industry analysts said.
      ""Now we've got a company that can compete with Air Canada,""
  said Thomas Bradley of Richardson Greenshields of Canada Ltd.
  ""Clearly, it can go head-to-head in any market.""
      The new airline, which arose from the 300-mln-Canadian-dlr
  takeover of Canadian Pacific Air Lines Ltd by the small but
  cash-rich Pacific Western Airlines Corp, was launched last week
  as Canadian Airlines International Ltd.
      Canadian Airlines will have 35-40 pct of the
  6-billion-Canadian-dlr domestic market, against Air Canada's
  50-55 pct. Wardair International Ltd is third with about nine
  pct.
      Analysts believe Pacific Western's aggressive and
  cost-conscious chairman Rhys Eyton will develop the true
  potential of the former CP Air, which floundered for four
  decades inside the bureaucracy of conglomerate Canadian Pacific
  Ltd.
      They said CP Air's management style had been not much
  different from that of Air Canada, formed 50 years ago, because
  neither airline was held accountable to its owners.
      ""Not that long ago, maybe even just six months ago, these
  two airlines were totally fiscally irresponsible. Neither
  seemed that concerned about the bottom line,"" said Bradley.
      ""But with CP Air being run by Eyton, it will be very
  conscious of profitability and shareholder return. And Air
  Canada is on the verge of going that way,"" he said.
      CP Air, always fighting for market share rather than
  profits, was ""a perennial money-loser,"" analyst Wilfred Hahn of
  Bache Securities Inc said in a recent report.
      Prior to its takeover in December, it had accumulated
  long-term debt of 600 mln Canadian dlrs. From 1981 to 1985, its
  losses totaled 87 mln Canadian dlrs.
      Air Canada, widely expected to be privatized later this
  year in a public share offering, lost 14.8 mln Canadian dlrs on
  revenues of 2.72 billion dlrs in 1985. It has a debt of more
  than 2 billion dlrs.
      Although only a minority interest is likely to be sold to
  the public, the prospect of privatization at a time of
  increased competition is forcing Air Canada to pay more
  attention to finances, analysts said.
      It recently disclosed that it expects to report a profit ""in
  excess of 35 mln to 40 mln dlrs"" for 1986. However, this profit
  recovery was due less to management skill than the fact that
  all Canadian airlines had a good year in 1986, analysts said.
      Tourists came to Canada in record numbers last year,
  attracted by the relatively weak Canadian dollar and Expo 86 in
  Vancouver, which alone had more than 22 mln visitors.
      For the next few years, most analysts see three-six pct air
  traffic growth, and they expect profits will come from
  cost-cutting and careful spending.
      Peter Friend of Walywn Stodgell Cochran Murray Ltd said
  institutional buyers will be eager to add Air Canada to their
  portfolios as a blue-chip investment, but warned that new
  competition makes profit growth less certain.
      ""The airline with something to lose will be Air Canada. At
  one time, it had a fixed system which was theirs and nobody
  else's,"" Friend said.
      Many analysts recommend that investors buy and hold airline
  shares for at least a year.
      Analysts said Air Canada's immediate concern ahead of a
  public stock offering will be unloading unprofitable air routes
  without setting off a political storm.
      It also will be faced with an expensive but necessary
  updating of its aging fleet of 111 aircraft.
      Wardair, preferring strong medicine now instead of later,
  already has embarked on a one-billion-Canadian-dlr purchase of
  a dozen aircraft from Europe's Airbus Industrie.
      Canadian Airlines, which has 81 aircraft, last week ordered
  six commuter planes from British Aerospace and said it would
  soon buy as many as six wide-bodied aircraft from Airbus or the
  Boeing Co.
      Analysts said Canadian Airlines, with its newer fleet,
  needs to make fewer replacements and can afford these without
  hurting profits.
      Steven Garmaise of Wood Gundy Inc expects Canadian
  Airlines' profit in 1988 will more than double last year's 29.8
  mln Canadian dlrs by Pacific Western.
  

"
529,2,"GENCORP &lt;GY> ALTERNATIVE PLAN DUE WITHIN A WEEK
  A. William Reynolds, chairman and
  chief executive of GenCorp Inc, told shareholders he expects to
  announce a company alternative to a 100-dlr-per-share hostile
  tender within a week.
      Last night the company urged shareholders to reject the
  tender. Reynolds urged shareholders to be patient, saying the
  group sponsoring the tender offer had months to evaluate
  GenCorp while ""we have had only 10 days to respond.""
      Reynolds also disclosed the company has resolved legal
  challenges to its planned sale of WOR TV, serving the New York
  City market, and expects to complete the sale by Friday.
      Reynolds said the company expects to book an after tax gain
  of 250 mln dlrs from the sale of WOR TV. The company plans to
  sell the station to MCA Inc &lt;MCA> for 387 mln dlrs.
      Reynolds did not specify whether the legal challenges were
  dropped or dismissed. The Federal Communications Commission has
  already approved the station's sale.
      Money from the sale of the station will play a role in
  helping develop an alternative to the tender offer co-sponsored
  by AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> and Wagner and Brown, Reynolds
  said. He provided no other details.
      Randall Hubbard, chairman of AFG, and Joel Reed, chief
  financial officer of Wagner and Brown, attended the meeting,
  which was shifted from a tire plant to a downtown hotel. About
  300 people were present despite an overnight snowstorm.
      Hubbard and Reed chatted briefly with Reynolds after the
  meeting but declined to discuss their proposal with reporters.
      Reynolds told the shareholders friends and family members
  have been telling him ""Bill, just don't pay greenmail"" to end
  the takeover threat. Greenmail describes a buyout of a minority
  shareholder at a price not available to other holders. Reynolds
  said he considers it a ""repugnant device.""
      Shareholders elected management's slate of 11 directors.
  Mario Gabelli, head of a New York investment firm which owns a
  large block of stock, proposed one nominee for the board.
  Gabelli said the unsuccessful attempt was designed to ""stiffen
  the backbone of the board to discourage greenmail.""
      Hubbard and Reed reiterated previous statements that they
  are open to negotiations with GenCorp.
      Asked about severance contracts for key executives in the
  event of a shift in control of the company, Reynolds asserted
  ""we're developing alternatives that would not result in a
  change in control.""
      Asked whether the company's plan would be superior to any
  proposal of AFG and Wagner and Brown, Reynolds commented, ""We
  know the company, we know the values and we know the
  opportunities better than any outside group.""
      In response to a question about whether any units are up
  for sale, he said only that GenCorp is evaluating alternatives.

  Avery Inc said the company will not

  profit in 1987.
      Speaking at the annual shareholders meeting, chairman
  Nelson Peltz declined to estimate when the company would become
  profitable.
      Peltz said Uniroyal Chemical Co, acquired last year, would
  increase Avery's operating earnings but that associated
  acquisition costs would prevent Avery from posting net profits
  for some time.
      At the meeting, stockholders approved an increase in the
  authorized number of common shares to 200 mln from 15 mln.
      In the fiscal year ended May 30, 1986, Avery reported a
  loss of 489,000 dlrs. The company has changed its fiscal year
  to end Sept 30.
      The increase in common shares would cover, among other
  things, the exercise of Triangle Industries Inc's &lt;TRI> and

  Avery's 710 mln dlr acquisition of Uniroyal Chemical late last

536,2,"TALKING POINT/BORG-WARNER CORP &lt;BOR>
  Borg-Warner Corp will vigorously
  resist GAF Corp's 46-dlr-per-share takeover offer, but the
  Midwest conglomerate may fall prey to another offer,
  either from GAF or its own management, analysts believe.
      Analysts also said Borg-Warner may attempt to escape GAF
  through a restructuring. The speculation pushed Borg-Warner's
  stock up 1-3/8 to 48-1/2 in heavy trading.
      Analysts predicted feisty GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman will
  stage a tough campaign to gain control of Borg-Warner so he can
  add its profitable plastics and chemical business to GAF.
      ""It seems from at least their dealing with (raider Irwin)
  Jacobs that they don't want to be taken over. The question is
  now do they acquiesce to GAF. I think instinctively, they want
  to remain independent,"" said Dudley Heer of Duff and Phelps.
      Borg-Warner has been under siege by takeover speculation
  for almost a year. Last week, Jacobs' investment vehicle,
  Minstar Inc, and an investor group sold its 10.1 mln
  Borg-Warner shares. The same day, GAF Corp raised its stake by
  9.1 mln shares to 19.9 pct of the outstanding.
      Jacobs was interested in buying the company, but took no
  steps toward a transaction.
      ""Their (Borg-Warner) policy has been to stonewall them for
  the last nine months. It's been one of the dullest corporate
  battles I've seen,"" said one analyst.
      The battle, however, has heated up, and the range of
  breakup values on Wall Street span from the current market
  price to almost 60 dlrs per share. Most analysts said they
  think a price in the low 50s would be appropriate.
      Arbitragers speculate that GAF will not give up easily on
  its 3.16 billion dlr offer to buy the balance of Borg-Warner.
      Analysts who know GAF predict Heyman will either end up
  with Borg-Warner or enrich his chemicals and building materials
  company in some other way. Heyman two years ago attempted an
  unsuccessful takeover of Union Carbide Corp, but GAF benefited
  from that company's restructuring.
      ""Borg Warner can't quibble that it's not a legitimate
  offer. It seems to me the short of it is Borg Warner is kind of
  between a rock and a hard place. They either have to accept a
  46 dlr proposal or perhaps work a deal where it's sweetened. I
  personally think the company is (worth) around 55 dlrs per
  share,"" said Pershing analyst Richard Henderson.
      Henderson also speculated the company might attempt a
  restructuring such as the one carried out by Goodyear Tire and
  Rubber Co last year when it was being courted by Sir James
  Goldsmith. The company bought back the financier's stock and
  carried out a wider share repurchase.
      Arbitragers, however, said they do not believe Heyman is
  seeking ""greenmail,"" or the repurchase of his stock by the
  company at a premium.
      Analysts noted that Heyman seems to have no problems with
  financing the transaction.
      Previously associated with ""junk bond"" experts, Drexel
  Burnham Lambert Inc, GAf said it would finance its Borg-Warner
  takeover with bank financing. GAF said it would make a tender
  offer following a merger agreement approved by the Borg-WArner
  board and conditioned on the board's recommendation of the
  tender offer and merger.
      Heyman said in a letter to Borg-Warner that he expects a
  merger would provide job security for Borg-Warner employees
  since the two companies businesses overlap. Analysts, however,
  believe Heyman would sell off assets he did not want to repay
  debt from the transaction.
      GAF's stock rose 1-5/8 today, to 48-5/8.
     ""I believe, obviously, if GAF takes over Borg-Warner at the
  level it is proposing it would enhance GAF share values
  substantially,"" said Oppenheimer analyst Charles Rose.
      He said at 46 dlrs per share, Heyman's average cost for the
  company's stock would be 44 dlrs per share based on GAF's
  current holdings.
      Rose said the Borg-Warner plastics and chemical business,
  which makes thermo-plastics is the asset attracting Heyman.
  Analysts said it accounts for a third of Borg's earnings.
      The plastics are used in telephone equipment, office
  equipment and appliances. ""Borg has half the market in the U.S.
  and is the leading technical player and the leading innovator,""
  Rose said. Its competitors are Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW> and
  Monsanto Corp &lt;MTC>, he said.
      Borg-Warner also has an automotive parts business, and a
  protective systems business, which includes Wells Fargo
  security guards. It also has an information services business,
  and is trying to sell its financial services business.
      Borg-Warner earned 206.1 mln dlrs or 2.35 dlrs per share on
  revenues of 3.62 billion dlrs in 1986. Smaller GAF, in 1986,
  earned on an operating basis 80.7 mln dlrs or 2.22 dlrs per
  share on sales of 753.8 mln dlrs.
      GAF's net earnings included an after tax gain of 201.4 mln
  from its participation in a Union Carbide exchange offer, a
  special union carbide dividend, and the sale of its Union
  Carbide shares.

  &lt;Royal Bank of Canada> said it
  estimates 1987 loan losses at one billion dlrs, a 25 mln dlr
  increase over last year.
      Royal Bank said it set its provisions ""given the continued
  debt-servicing problems ... in the North American energy
  industry and the uncertain outlook for energy prices,"" and also
  continued to add to its general provisions for loans to
  troubled borrower countries.
      The bank's loan loss provision for the first quarter ended
  January 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in the
  year-ago quarter.
      The bank said non-accrual loans, net of provisions for loan
  losses, totalled 2.2 billion dlrs on January 31, up from 2.0
  billion dlrs a year ago.
      In reporting lower first quarter earnings, chairman Allan
  Taylor said problems with credit quality--particularly in loans
  associated with the energy sector--continue to have a
  substantial adverse effect on the bank's earnings.
      Taylor said profitability of the bank's international
  operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related
  difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and
  unsatisfactory results from capital market activities.
      Taylor said it would be premature to speculate on the
  outcome of debt resturcturing negotiations with Brazil or their
  potential impact on the Royal Bank.
      The bank earlier reported first quarter profit fell to
  114.1 mln dlrs from 140.4 mln dlrs a year ago.

  Ames Department Stores Inc fell 1-7/8
  to 23 in what analysts said was a reaction to a surprise
  announcement earlier today by the company that earnings in the

      Ames said it expects to report earnings of between 72 and
  77 cts per share compared with 1.19 dlrs per share in the
  previous year.
      ""We were looking for 1.15 dlrs,"" said an analyst at a major
  Wall Street firm who declined to be identified. Ames said most
  of the decline resulted from an inventory shortage at its
  Secaucus, N.J. distribution center.
      ""The obvious suspicion is that there has been some kind of
  fraud or theft,"" said Ralph Shulansky, senior vice president of
  Ames. ""We do not have hard evidence we are still putting things
  together.""
      He said it would take several weeks for the company to
  complete an investigation. He said there are no law enforcement
  officials involved at this time.
      He declined to quantify the inventory shortage but said it
  was the major reason for the decline in earnings. A decline in
  gross margin percentage and an increase in the effective tax
  rate also contributed to the downturn, Ames said.

  First Central Financial Corp said it
  expects earnings to rise significantly in 1987 and said it is
  actively seeking an acquisition.
      The property and casualty insurance company's chairman and
  chief executive officer, Martin J. Simon, told Reuters in an
  interview that he expects earnings of 33 cts a share in 1987
  compared with 25 cts a year ago.
      He said, ""the company currently has the sufficient momentum
  to achieve those earnings and the successful completion of
  licensing applications to operate in Pennsylvania, Delaware,
  Connecticut and Ohio should fuel our earnings.""
      The company is currently licenced to operate only in New
  York state.
      Simon estimated that the company would earn seven cts a
  share in the first quarter compared to three cts in the same
  quarter a year ago, and eight cts a share in the second quarter
  compared to five cts earned in 1986. He expects the company to
  earn nine cts a share for each of the final two quarters of
  1987.
      In addition, Simon said, First Central Financial ""is
  actively looking for, and has several acquisition brokers
  looking for a small life insurance company to acquire.""
      He said the acquisition should be in the 10 mln dlr range
  and will be part of a strategy of expanding the company into a
  ""wide spectrum of insurance services."" No specific company has
  been targeted as yet, ""but I would like to make my first
  acquisition in 1987,"" he said.
      He said First Central Financial would not itself be an easy

  has implemented a staggered board of directors system. In

  GAF Corp chairman Samuel Heyman told

  if GAF's 46 dlr-per-share offer to acquire Borg-Warner is
  successful.
      ""We have great respect for Borg-Warner mangagement,"" Heyman
  said, following a speech at the American Institute of Chemical
  Engineers annual meeting. ""We don't have any particular changes
  in mind.""
      Earlier today, GAF announced that a 3.16-billion-dlr-offer
  was presented to the board of directors of the Chicago-based
  company.
      Last week, GAF had purchased additional shares of the
  company for 40-1/8 dlrs, increasing its stake in Borg-Warner to
  19.9 pct.
      In 1985, GAF made an unsuccessful effort to acquire Union
  Carbide Corp for five billion dlrs, and has since expressed an
  interest in acquiring a chemical company that would complement
  its own chemical business.
      When asked whether GAF would consider selling the
  non-chemical assets of Borg-Warner if its takeover offer is
  accepted, Heyman declined to comment.
      He also refused to say whether GAF would consider
  increasing its the dollar value of its takeover offer if the
  initial proposal is rejected.
      Heyman emphasized that he considered the GAF offer to
  Borg-Warner to be a friendly one.
      ""We think we made a fair offer that is good for Borg-Warner
  management and good for its shareholders,"" Heyman said.
       In his speech, Heyman said he feared too many chemical
  companies were attempting to specialize in the same high margin
  niche products.
      He said they were turning their backs on core commodity
  chemical businesses. 
      Heyman said the chemical industry has taken a total of
  seven billion dlrs in pre-tax writeoffs during the past two
  years to trim balance sheets.
      He predicted that the U.S. chemical industry, which
  reported a total of 13 billion dlrs in 1986 profits, would see
  a 20 pct gain in earnings this year because of increasing
  exports, cheaper feedstock costs and the weakened U.S. dlr.

623,1,"DOME PETE&lt;DMP> TAKES 2.08 BILLION DLR WRITEDOWN
  Dome Petroleum Ltd, earlier
  reporting a 2.20 billion dlr 1986 loss compared to year-earlier
  profit of 7.0 mln dlrs, said the loss was mainly due to write
  downs totalling 2.084 billion dlrs before a reduction in
  deferred income taxes of 571 mln dlrs.
      The loss also includes 214 mln dlrs in accumulated foreign
  exchange losses, the company said.
      ""The dramatic drop in energy prices in early 1986 reverses
  much of the progress the company has made in the two previous
  years,"" Dome chairman J. Howard Macdonald said in a statement.
      ""But even a net loss of this magnitude has very little
  bearing on the day-to-day operations of Dome,"" chairman
  Macdonald said.
      ""It merely reflects the realistic carrying value of the
  company's assets in today's economic environment, and the
  absolute need for reaching a timely agreement with our lenders
  on a debt restructuring plan to assure the company's continued
  existence,"" he added.
      Dome is now trying to reach agreement on a complex plan for
  restructuring debt of more than 6.10 billion dlrs.
      Dome said it charged the 214 mln dlrs in accumulated
  foreign exchange losses to current expenses because of the
  uncertainty arising from its proposed restructuring plan.
      Normally the expenses would be amortized over the remaining
  period of the loans to which they apply, it said.
      Dome also said the write downs included a fourth quarter
  reduction in the value of its oil and gas properties of 1.20
  billion dlrs, before a reduction in deferred income taxes of
  305 mln dlrs. The fourth quarter writedown was in addition to a
  charge of 880 mln dlrs on certain other assets, taken mainly in
  the third quarter.
      Dome said the 1.20 billion dlr fourth quarter charge
  resulted from a year-end accounting change made under new full
  cost accounting guidelines by the Canadian Institute of
  Chartered Accountants.
      The company said it previously determined a write down of
  conventional oil and gas properties was not required at
  September 30, under the previous method of calculating the
  limitation of oil and gas values.
      Dome said the most significant accounting change under the
  new guidelines is using current oil and gas prices in
  calculations instead of escalating price forecasts.
      Terms of Dome's proposed debt restructuring plan preclude
  the company from making an accurate estimate of future
  financing costs, which are used in the new accounting
  calculations, it said.
      As a result, Dome adopted current prices and costs and a 10
  pct discount factor in the calculations, which substantially
  conform with accounting rules prescribed by the U.S. Securities
  and Exchange Commission, the company said.
      Dome said operating income from its crude oil and natural
  gas segments fell by 2.50 billion dlrs to a 1986 loss of 1.71
  billion dlrs from prior year earnings of 737.0 mln dlrs.
      Dome said the steep drop in crude oil and natural gas
  operating income was due to write downs totalling 1.93 billion
  dlrs and lower energy prices that sharply reduced revenue.
      Reduced production of natural gas and lower utilization of
  Dome's offshore drilling fleet in the Beaufort Sea also
  contributed to the decline, it said.
      Earnings from its natural gas liquids business fell by 79
  pct to 42.0 mln dlrs from 199 mln dlrs in 1985.
      Cash from operations dropped to 5.0 mln dlrs from year-ago
  542.0 mln dlrs and unrestricted cash balance declined to 202.0
  mln dlrs from 466.0 mln dlrs.
      Dome said 1986 crude oil production in 1986 was maintained
  at prior year's levels through new drilling activity and
  improvements in productivity.
      Natural gas production fell by nine pct as a result of
  lower domestic and export sales, it said.
      Oil and field natural gas liquids production totalled
  86,000 barrels a day, compared to 87,000 bpd in the prior year.
      Natural gas production fell to 536.0 mln cubic feet a day
  from 591.0 mcf a day.

  pct to 2.88 billion dlrs. It said the 2.23 dlrs a share earned

626,1,"PACIFIC GAS &lt;PCG> ACCOUNTING CHANGE TO CUT NET
  Pacific Gas and Electric Co said
  it expects to record a 470 mln dlr, or 1.25 dlr per share,
  reduction in 1987 earnings because of the company's decision to
  change the method used to record Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power
  Plant revenues.
      The accounting change will not affect the company's cash
  position and the company intends to continue paying its
  dividend at the annual rate of 1.92 dlrs per share.
      Last year Pacific Gas reported earnings of 925 mln dlrs, or
  2.60 dlrs per share.
      Pacific Gas said the accounting change was prompted by
  delays in the receipt of a California Public Utilities
  Commission decision on the company's 1984 application for rate
  relief to recover the 5.8 billion dlr cost of constructing
  units one and two of the Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Project.
      It said the commission is currently allowing the company to
  recover 40 pct of the cost of owning and operating the plants.
      As a result, 63 mln dlrs has been accumulating each month
  as deferred non-cash account receivable, which has been
  included in current income.
      But the accounting change, effective January 1, will
  reflect only cash received through interim rates approved by
  the commission, Pacific Gas and Electric said.
      It also said the commission is now awaiting its Public
  Staff Division's report which will recommend how much of the
  5.8 billion dlr investment Pacific Gas should be allowed to
  recover in rates.
      The company further stated that it is confident it will
  receive an objective review of the facts.
      It also said it intends to seek additional interim rates.
      Pacific Gas began construction of the two nuclear power
  units in 1969. After a number of construction delays, unit one
  went into operation in May 1985 and unit two went on line in
  March last year.

644,1,"AUDITORS GIVE FIRST CITY &lt;FBT> QUALIFIED OPINION
  First City Bancorp of Texas, which lost
  a record 402 mln dlrs in 1986, said in its annual report it
  expected operating losses to continue ""for the foreseeable
  future"" as it continues to search for additional capital or a
  merger partner.
      The Houston-based bank's 1986 financial statements received
  a qualified opinion from its auditors, Arthur Andersen and Co.
  The auditors said their opinion was subject to First City
  eventually obtaining additional capital.
      ""The company believes that in order to address its
  long-term needs and return to a satisfactory level of
  operations, it will ultimately need several hundred million
  dollars of additional capital, or a combination with a more
  strongly capitalized entity,"" First City said in a note to its
  financial statements included in the annual report.
      ""Management believes that sufficient resources should be
  available to cover interim capital concerns while additional
  capital is being sought,"" the bank said.
      To raise cash in the near-term, First City said it may sell
  or mortgage non-strategic assets, recover excess contributions
  to its pension plan and obtain special dividends from some of
  its member banks.
      ""The losses for 1987 are expected to be substantially less
  than in 1986,"" First City chairman J.A. Elkins said in a letter
  included in the annual report. ""However, the ultimate return to
  satisfactory operating conditions is dependent on the
  successful resolution of the related problems of credit
  quality, funding and the eventual need for substantial
  additional capital.""
      First City said it anticipated that certain covenants of a
  credit agreement with unaffiliated banks requiring most of
  First City's excess cash to be applied to debt repayments would
  be modified by the end of the first quarter in order to avoid
  default.
      The banks agreed to similar amendments to the covenants
  last year and First City has reduced its borrowings from 120
  mln dlrs at 1986 yearend to 68.5 mln dlrs in recent weeks.
      Although the parent company's capital adequacy ratios
  exceeded regulatory minimum requirements at the end of 1986,
  First City said its two largest subsidiaries did not. First
  City National Bank of Houston had a primary capital ratio of
  5.34 pct and First City Bank of Dallas had a 4.75 pct ratio.
      Hard-hit by the collapse in oil and Texas real estate
  prices, First City's net loan chargeoffs totaled 366 mln dlrs
  last year, up from 261 mln dlrs in 1985. The bank more than
  doubled its loan loss provision to 497 mln dlrs at the end of
  1986.
      First City said chargeoffs and paydowns reduced its total
  energy loan portfolio by 32 pct during 1986, to 1.4 billion
  dlrs at year-end, adding that future energy chargeoffs ""should
  be more modest."" The amount represented 15 pct of First City's
  total loans.
      In real estate, First City said its nonperforming assets
  nearly doubled last year to 347 mln dlrs at year-end.
  Chargeoffs of real estate loans rose to 32 mln dlrs, or nine
  pct of total loan chargeoffs, and the bank said the amount
  could go higher.
      ""The company still faces uncertainties in the real estate
  market and anticipates further deterioration in the pportfolio
  so long as the regional recession persists,"" First City said.
  ""Because the carrying value of many of these loans is
  collateral dependent, a further decline in the overall value of
  the collateral base could cause an increase in the level of
  real estate-related chargeoffs.""

"
651,2,"EMERY AIR &lt;EAF> TO BID FOR PUROLATOR &lt;PCC> 
  Emery Air Freight Corp said it
  plans to begin tomorrow a 40 dlr a share tender offer for 83
  pct of the outstanding common stock of Purolator Courier Corp.
      The company said the tender offer is the first step in a
  plan to buy 100 pct of the Purolator shares.
      Following the tender offer, Emery said it would offer 40
  dlrs of junior subordinated debentures for each remaining
  Purolator share outstanding.
      On March one, Purolator agreed to a 35 dlr a share
  leveraged buyout by eight Purolator executives and EF Hutton
  LBO Inc, a unit of EF Hutton Group Inc.
      Emery said it had tried unsuccessfully to open merger
  discussions with Purolator before the company accepted the
  management-led buyout offer.
      In a letter to Purolator's chairman, Nicholas F. Brady,
  Emery's chairman, John C. Emery, said the company would still
  prefer to negotiate with Purolator.
      But he said the imminent expiration of the leveraged buyout
  group's offer has forced the company to make an unsolicited
  tender offer of its own.
      Emery said its offer is scheduled to expire at 2400 EST on
  April 28, unless extended.
      The company said conditions of the offer include the
  receipt of at least two-thirds of Purolator's shares
  outstanding, on a fully diluted basis, and the repeal of its
  share purchase rights plan.
      Emery said the offer is also subject to completion of the
  previously announced sale of Purolator's Canadian operations.
      Emery said Chemical Bank, Bankers Trust, Morgan Guaranty
  Trust Co and Salomon Bros had agreed to provide financing for
  the tender offer.
      It said the junior subordinated debentures to be issued in
  the subsequent merger will carry a 13 pct annual interest rate,
  payable twice a year.
      For the first three years after the notes are issued,
  interest will be paid, at Emery's option, in cash or in
  additional notes, Emery said.
      It added that the notes will not be subject to redemption
  for one year after they are issued.
      Emery said Purolator would operate as a wholly owned unit
  of the company after the merger. It said it hoped Purolator's
  management would continue with the company.
      ""We believe that our two companies provide an excellent fit
  with each other and that the combination will enable each of us
  to better serve our existing customers and meet the challenges
  of the future,"" Emery's chairman said in his letter.
      He said a merger would significantly enhance the financial
  turnaround that Purolator's management had previously forecast.
      Officials at Purolator could not immediately be reached for
  comment on the offer, which was released several hours after
  the stock market had closed.
      Emery's stock closed up 1/2 at 12-5/8.
      Purolator closed at 34-7/8, off 5/8.

653,1,"COMMERZBANK SEES LOWER OPERATING PROFIT THIS YEAR
  Commerzbank AG &lt;CBKG.F> management
  board chairman Walter Seipp said that from the present
  viewpoint the bank must expect 1987 full operating profit to be
  lower than in 1986.
      In the first two months of the year, partial operating
  profit -- excluding trading on the bank's own account -
  declined, he said, without giving details.
      The interest surplus fell 2.8 pct compared with 2/12ths of
  1986 results, while the commission surplus, because of the
  quiet stock exchange business, fell back still more strongly.
  By contrast the personnel and fixed asset expenses increased.
      German banks do not report full operating profit. But Seipp
  said last year the figure for the first time had topped one
  billion marks for the parent bank, and the group result was
  around 50 pct higher than this.
      Commenting on 1986, Seipp said, ""we were able to raise the
  full operating profit...Slightly above the record result of
  1985 because own account profits increased slightly.""
      He gave no concrete details but added that in January and
  February, good own account trading profits meant that the drop
  in full operating earnings was more modest than that in the
  partial operating figure.
      The bank would, as a result, be more profit-oriented in
  future, developing, for example, more into investment banking,
  keeping a tight rein on personnel costs and dampening
  expenditures on fixed assets.
      Turning to 1986 results, Seipp said by year end there had
  been a strong growth in business volume.
      Over the year business volume rose by 9.9 pct to 93.2
  billion marks compared with 1985, Seipp added.
      Group balance sheet volume rose by 8.0 pct to 148.15
  billion. It would have been around five billion marks higher
  still if currency relationships had remained unchanged.
      In the parent bank, the interest surplus rose nine pct in
  the year, while the interest margin held roughly at 1985's 2.56
  pct despite pressure on credit rates.
      The surplus on commission business, which had soared by a
  quarter in 1985, rose by 11.6 pct last year thanks almost
  exclusively to growth in securities commissions, Seipp said.
      Personnel expenditure was up 11.9 pct last year, at more
  than 1.5 billion marks. Fixed asset expenditure rose by 9.6 pct
  to more than 650 mln.
      As a result, the parent bank partial operating profit rose
  by 3.2 pct to 752 mln marks.
      Parent bank tax payment rose to 244 mln marks last year
  from 233 mln in 1985.
      Seipp said extraordinary earnings included a ""high
  two-figure million"" in profit from the sale of the bank's AEG AG
  &lt;AEGG.F> shares to Daimler-Benz AG &lt;DAIG.F> during the latter's
  majority stake purchase booked last year.
      The ability of the bank to write off depreciations in
  credit business against profits from securities trading and
  earnings on the sale of stakes had been utilised, as in prior
  years, to its full extent.
      Because of numerous insolvencies at home, by far the
  largest part of the provisions were set aside for individual
  write-downs from domestic business. Abroad, the circle of
  problem debtor countries rose last year, although the ratio of
  credit exposure to provisions improved further.
      Seipp said that because about half the group's exposure to
  problem nations was in dollars, the bank had swapped into
  dollars individual provisions hitherto held primarily in marks.
      ""This means that no open currency positions exist any longer
  on the amount of the provision that is made against an actual
  default,"" he added.
      Despite the increase in concern over debtor nations in the
  last few weeks, he said, the international banking community is
  better armed than it was against payment problems.
      All banks had significantly strengthened their capital
  base, most European banks had made considerable provisions
  against bad debts while goverments and central banks were
  better prepared for unforseen difficulties.
      He described debt-equity swaps as a very interesting new
  approach to indebted nations' problems. There was a lot of
  interest in direct investment via an equity participation in
  Latin America, particularly from West German firms.

679,2,"U.S. SUPREME COURT ALLOWS DELTA-WESTERN MERGER
  U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day
  O'Connor early this morning lifted an Appeals Court injunction
  blocking the planned merger of Delta &lt;DAL> Airlines
  Inc and Western Airlines &lt;WAL>, the Court said.
      O'Connor's action came hours after a three-judge panel of
  the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco had
  blocked the merger until a dispute over union representation
  had been settled by arbitration.
      A Supreme Court spokesman said O'Connor granted a stay of
  the injuction, allowing the merger, worth nearly 860 mln dlrs,
  to go through as planned later today.
      The Supreme Court spokesman provided no other details. Each
  of the nine Supreme Court justices has jurisdiction over a
  particular regional Appellate circuit and has the power to
  provisionally overturn its rulings without comment.
      The Appeals Court ruling surprised officials of
  Atlanta-based Delta, which had been preparing for the merger
  for months and had already painted Delta logos on airplanes
  belonging to Western, which has headquartera in Los Angeles.
      ""Our plans were to finalize the merger at midnight tonight,""
  Delta spokesman Bill Berry told the Atlanta Constitution late
  last night. ""There was really very little that remained to be
  done.""
      The ruling in San Francisco came in a lawsuit that had been
  filed in a Los Angeles federal court in which the Air Transport
  Employees union sought to force Western's management to fulfill
  a promise that it would honor union contracts if a merger took
  place.
      The airlines argued that Western's promise could not be
  enforced in a takeover by a larger company.
      After learning of the appeals court ruling, Delta officials
  last night spread the word by telephone that Western employees
  should report for work today in their old uniforms, not in new
  Delta outfits.
      Delta announced last September that it was purchasing
  Western. The merger took place in December, and Western has
  been operated as a Delta subsidiary since then. The Western
  name was to have disappeared at midnight last night.
      At issue is whether the Western unions would continue to
  represent Western employees after the integration of the two
  airlines.
      While all but eight pct of Western's 11,000 employees are
  unionized, only Delta's pilots are union members.
      Delta had maintained that the three unions having contracts
  with Western -- The Association of Flight Attendants and the
  Teamsters, as well as the Air Transport Employees -- would be
  ""extinguished"" after today.

  &lt;Royal Bank of Canada>, in reporting a

  report improved results in future earnings periods.
      ""Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income,
  highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and
  a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of
  non-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the
  periods ahead,"" chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement.
      The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter
  ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year
  ago.
      Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to
  substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank's
  international operations remains weak, reflecting
  resource-related difficulties of private and public sector
  borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market
  activities.
      The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103
  mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while
  earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs
  from 42 mln dlrs last year.
      Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest
  income declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues
  from international investment banking as well as a significant
  loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago.
      Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last
  year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail
  deposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but
  lower securities commissions from international investment bank
  operations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said.
      The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to
  98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in
  consumer lending, particularly residential mortgages.

  Diamond Shamrock Corp, which will split

  improved earnings in 1987 over last year, executives of the new
  company told Reuters.
      Charles Blackburn, president and chief executive officer of
  Diamond Shamrock and the new company, which will emphasize
  exploration and production, said, ""Earnings wil be better than
  in 1986."" He declined to say how much better.
      In 1986 Diamond Shamrock reported a loss of 115.6 mln dlrs
  on total revenues of 2.543 billion dlrs. Exploration and
  production lost 18.5 mln dlrs on revenues of 593.5 mln dlrs.
      Roger Hemminghaus, Diamond Shamrock vice president and
  soon-to-be chief executive of the spin-off Diamond Shamrock
  Refining and Marketing Co, said, ""Refining and marketing is a
  margin business. The margins will return and this will be a
  better year than 1986.""
      In 1986, refining and marketing showed operating profits of
  40.1 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.636 billion dlrs.
      ""We are also expecting to be in the black in the first
  quarter (1987),"" Heminghaus added. In the first quarter of 1986,
  the refining and marketing segment showed a loss of 27.1 mln
  dlrs on revenues of 492.1 mln dlrs.
     
      The executives were in New york for meetings with
  institutional investors aimed at increasing interest in the
  company's stock.
      On the New York Stock Exchange, Diamond Shamrock was
  trading at 16-1/4, down 1/4.
      Earlier this year, T. Boone Pickens offered 15 dlrs a share
  for Diamond Shamrock, and management countered with an offer at
  17 dlrs and a decision to split off the refining and marketing
  operation to its shareholders.

  share. Next year, based on an average oil price of 18 dlrs a
  barrel, ARCO should earn about five dlrs a share. The company
  earned 3.38 dlrs a share in 1986. ""If oil prices should rise to
  an average of 20 dlrs a barrel,"" he said, ""ARCO could record
  earnings of 6.50 dlrs a share.
      Nowak said his increased estimates come after the company
  told analysts yesterday that its first quarter earnings will
  comfortably cover its quarterly dividend requirement of one dlr
  a share.
      Nowak said, ""The company has done an outstanding job
  reducing expenses, and ARCO is poised to generate greater
  earnings power."" He said first quarter earnings will likely
  exceed the company's expectations stated yesterday and be in
  the 1.15-1.20 dlr-a-share range.

769,1,"WALL STREET STOCKS/ANACOMP INC &lt;AAC>
  Anacomp Inc, one of the most actively
  traded NYSE issues, rose today as at least one analyst expected
  earnings to be boosted by its planned acquisition of a
  micrographics company.
      Anacomp rose 1/2 to 6-3/4 on volume of 950,000 shares after
  trading as high as seven earlier.
      Howard Harlow, analyst at Whale Securities Corp, said
  Anacomp's earnings for fiscal 1987 ending September 31 could be
  doubled to 80 cts a share from the 40 cts a share he had
  forecast before Anacomp agreed to buy DatagraphiX, a
  micrographics firm, from General Dynamics Corp &lt;GD>.
      ""The company can earn 80 cts a share in fiscal 1987, maybe
  as much as a dlr a share, because of DatagraphiX,"" Harlow said.
  ""Most of the benefit will be in the fourth qtr because it will
  integrate the company in the second half.""
      Anacomp's earnings will be less if it has problems
  integrating DatagraphiX, Harlow said.
      A spokesman at Anacomp said the company expects to complete
  its deal for DatagraphiX later this month. She would not say
  how much it will pay for DatagraphiX, but noted that
  DatagraphiX contributed 10 mln dlrs in earnings to General
  Dynamics on revenues of 239 mln dlrs in 1986.
      Harlow said a fellow analyst at Whale Securities estimates
  that Anacomp will pay between 100 mln dlrs to 150 mln dlrs for
  DatagraphiX. ""The estimates on the street narrow it down to
  between 110 mln dlrs and 130 mln dlrs,"" Harlow added.
      Anacomp reported net of 2.8 mln dlrs or nine cts a share in
  its first qtr ended December 31, up from 301,000 dlrs or one ct
  a share.
      In Anacomp's fiscal 1986 it earned 4,073,000 dlrs or 13 cts
  a share.
      Whale Securities recommends buying the stock, Harlow said.

      Due to the transaction, Horn and Hardart is projecting a

  Bojangles' restaurants and is in accordance with its
  restructuring program announced in October 1986.
      A spokesman said the company is considering the sale or
  spinoff of the 91-company owned additional restaurants, which
  are profitable.
      The company said the disposition will result in no profit
  or loss for the company because the costs were anticipated in a
  34-mln-dlr reserve taken in the third quarter of 1986.
      The foodservice division, which includes Burger King,

  Conrac Corp, whose board has
  rejected a 25 dlr a share tender offer from Mark IV Industries
  Inc &lt;IV>, said it is exploring alternatives such as a
  restructuring, leveraged buyout or takeover of the company.
       In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  Conrac said its board of directors authorized its financial and
  legal advisors to explore a several alternatives to the Mark IV
  offer, which it said it considers inadequate.
      The alternatives being explored include a restructuring,
  leveraged buyout or a takeover of the company by another
  company, Conrac said.
      Conrac, which said its board discussed the alternatives at
  special meetings on March 26 and 30, said that its decision on
  whether to adopt any of the alternatives would hinge on ""the
  future actions of Mark IV"" and its unsolicitied tender offer.
      Putting into effect any of the alternatives being explored
  could hurt or defeat the Mark IV offer, it said.
      Board members were also instructed to keep confidential the
  terms of any transaction that might be entered into until it
  becomes final, the company said.
      The board also took other defensive steps, including
  granting severance agreements to some officers, it said.
      At a board meeting yesterday, Concac's directors deleted a
  provision allowing the holder of at least one-third of of all
  classes of its voting stock to call a special shareholders
  meeting and deleted another provision allowing shareholders to
  remove directors without cause, the company said.
      The defensive moves were taken because Mark IV had said it
  planned to elect a majority of its designees as directors at a
  special holders meeting if it succeeded in acquring a majority
  of the company's common stock in the offer, Conrac said.
      Conrac's president, vice president and treasurer were given
  severance agreements, or ""golden parachutes,"" it said.
      Under the agreements, Conrac President Paul Graf would get
  a cash payment of twice his annual salary, which was 209,906
  dlrs last year, if there were a change of control in the
  company, including acquisition of 30 pct or more of the
  company's voting stock, Conrac said.
      Treasurer Joseph Smorada and Vice President Joseph
  O'Donnell, who made 143,325 dlrs last year, would get
  one-and-a-half times his salary if there were a change in
  control. Smorada's salary was not listed in the SEC filing.
      The executives would also get cash settlements of options
  plans and continuation of insurance and other benefits.

  E.F. Hutton Group's E.F. Hutton LBO Inc
  unit said it extended the expiration date for its 35 dlr per
  share tender offer for Purolator Courier corp to midnight EST
  April six from midnight April one.
      E.F. Hutton lbo inc said its wholly owned PC Acquisition
  Inc subsidiary, which is the entity making the offer, extended
  both expiration date and the withdrawal rights period for its
  pending tender for 6.3 mln shares or 83 pct of Purolator
  common.
      Hutton's offer was topped today by a 40 dlr per share bid
  for 83 pct of the stock from Emery Air Frieght Corp &lt;EAF.>
      Both offers would pay shareholders a package of securities
  for the balance of their shares, valued at the respective
  tender offer prices.
      Hutton said as of the end of the day yesterday, about
  880,000 shares of Purolator common stock repesenting 11.5 pct
  of outstanding shares had been validly tendered and not
  withdrawn.
      Manhattan supreme court justice Lewis Grossman today
  adjourned until Monday a hearing on a stockholder suit seeking
  to block the Hutton LBO transaction. The judge told attorneys
  he needed time to hear other cases.
      Plaintiffs cited their belief that a superior offer would
  be forthcoming, however one company mentioned in an affadavit,
  Interlink Express plc, denied that it was interested.
      Yesterday, Frank Hoenemeyer, a retired vice chairman of
  Prudential Insurance Co and currently a Purolator board member,
  said an initial offer from Hutton was rejected by the board of
  directors February third.
      Hoenemeyer testified that by the next meeting of the board,
  February 17, Hutton submitted a revised proposal which was
  accepted.
      He also testified a committee of directors had hired
  Goldman Sachs and Co to consider alternatives to the Hutton
  offer and also to consider a discussion of possible mergers

813,2,"TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER &lt;PCC>
  Emery Air Freight Corp topped a
  leveraged buyout offer for Purolator Courier Corp by about 40
  mln dlrs, but Wall Street is reacting as though another offer
  may surface.
      Purolator's stock climbed 5-3/8 today, to 40-1/8, 1/4 over
  Emery's 40 dlr per share offer. Emery topped a 35 dlr per share
  or 268 mln dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc.
      Some analysts said the latest, 306 mln dlr offer for
  Purolator exceeded their expectations.
      Several analysts previously had said they saw takeover
  values for the package delivery company in the 35 dlr per share
  range. At least one, however, estimated the company could be
  taken over in a range of 38 to 42 dlrs per share.
      Analysts today would not venture to say whether another
  offer could be made, but some arbitragers still held to the
  belief that the bidding could go higher.
      ""They have no choice to seek out the best possible offer.
  Emery has shown the courage to go forth,"" said one arbitrager,
  who speculated other courier companies may also emerge as
  bidders.
      ""It makes sense,"" said James Parker of Robinson Humphrey.
  But ""It won't make out as well as they think. They won't get a
  100 pct of the synergies.""
      Analysts said the acquisition could cost Emery earnings in
  the short term, but long term, after eliminating redundancies
  and selling other Purolator assets, it should boost Emery's
  profitability.
      Parker said a combined Purolator and Emery would rival
  United Parcel Service as the second largest U.S. package
  delivery company after Federal Express Corp &lt;FDX>, which has 47
  pct of the market.
      Parker speculated that the combined Emery-Purolator would
  have about 24 pct of the six to seven billion dlr delivery
  business.
      ""This will make Emery a bigger factor in the light weight
  (delivery) business, but it will not make them a power house,""
  said Douglas Arthur of Kidder, Peabody and Co.
      Purolator today declined comment on the Emery offer, and
  its chairman Nicholas Brady did not return a phone call.
      E.F.Hutton LBO also declined comment on the Emery offer,
  but said it extended the expiration and withdrawal period on
  its offer to April six at midnight from today at midnight EST.
      One analyst speculated the extension makes it more likely
  Hutton will attempt another offer. However, he was skeptical a
  company outside the package delivery industry would want to
  outbid 40 dlrs per share because it would not have the same 
  synergies as a courier company.
      Since Purolator agreed in late February to a buyout by some
  of its management and the E.F. Hutton Group &lt;EFH> subsidiary,
  speculation has arisen that more bidding was to come.
      The buyout was surrounded by controversy since a Purolator
  board member, Doresy Gardner resigned in March. Gardner said he
  believed a better offer could be made by another entity.
      A spokesman for Gardner today said the former director had
  no contact with Emery, nor did he have any other buyers lined
  up for Purolator.
      Purolator's deal with Hutton was also called into question
  by a shareholder suit filed earlier this week, which attempted
  to stop the tender offer to allow another bidder to come forth.
  Hearings in a New York state court were delayed until Monday.
      Arbitragers had said they believed the Hutton offer could
  be bettered because the Wall Street firm was not planning to
  keep its cash tied up in Purolator. Hutton is providing a 279
  mln dlr ""bridge"" loan that would later be replaced with other
  debt. Hutton would maintain a majority interest in Purolator.
      Hutton sources have said the firm was in fact facing risk n
  its investment since it did not know when it could reclaim its
  279 mln dlr loan.
      Emery last year lost 5.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 887.5 mln
  dlrs. Purolator lost 57.6 mln dlrs on 841.4 mln dlrs in
  revenues.

  Rumors that New York investor Asher

  higher, traders said.

      ""Speculation that Edelman was going to take a stake in
  Polaroid was kicking around a few months ago, and resurfaced
  today,"" one trader said.
      Edelman had no comment on the rumors.
      A spokesman for Polaroid said the company had not been
  contacted by Edelman and no filing had been made with the
  Securities and Exchange Commission about a stake in the
  company.
      ""There is some hope among investors that there will some
  progress in the status hearing tomorrow on the patent
  infringement suit with Kodak,"" analyst Michael Ellmann of
  Wertheim and Co said.
      Traders said it is conceivable that a trial date could be
  set or some progress made on an out-of-court settlement.
      The suit, filed by Polaroid in April 1976, charges that
  Kodak infringed upon Polaroid's instant camera patent. In
  October 1985, the court barred Kodak from selling cameras or
  film that infringe upon the patent, the Polaroid spokesman
  said.
      Ellmann said he feels it is highly unlikely that any
  progress will be made in tomorrow's hearing.
      Ellmann said the stock may have also gotten a boost today
  from some optimism concerning new products the company is
  currently working on.
      ""Polaroid's announcement that a particularly senior company
  executive had been chosen to work on a major unidentified new
  product spurred some speculation about their products,"" he
  said. ""I am speculating that the new product could be an
  electronic still camera,"" referring to a camera that records
  its images on magnetic disks as opposed to conventional film.

      The move, which follows Brazil's suspension of interest
  payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt on February
  20, is expected to reduce first quarter net income by about 20
  mln dlrs, of which four mln dlrs represents interest accrued
  prior to 1987 but still uncollected, the bank said.

  assuming cash interest payments are not received for the rest
  of the year, 1987 net income would be reduced by about 72 mln
  dlrs. 1986 net income was 872.5 mln dlrs.
      Although U.S. banks do not have to put loans on nonaccrual

891,1,"DEUTSCHE BANK SEES SLOW START TO 1987
  Deutsche Bank AG &lt;DBKG.F> has seen a
  slow start to 1987 after posting record profits in 1986,
  management board joint spokesman F. Wilhelm Christians said.
      Credit business declined in the first few weeks of the
  year, and the interest margin was squeezed further. The weak
  German bourse saw earnings on commission fall sharply, and
  trading in securities also fell. But earnings from currency
  dealing were still satisfactory, he told a news conference.
      Deutsche group partial operating profits rose to 3.78
  billion marks in 1986 from 2.92 billion in 1985 on a balance
  sheet of 257.22 billion marks after 237.23 billion.
      Profits were swollen by earnings from the placement of the
  former Flick group, which have been estimated at some one
  billion marks, and from record profits in trading on the bank's
  own account, not included in partial operating profits.
      Earnings from the Flick transaction were booked through a
  subsidiary, and therefore showed up as part of the interest
  surplus in a section current earnings from securities and
  participations.
      In the group this nearly doubled to 2.64 billion marks from
  1.45 billion.
      As usual the bank did not detail total operating profits.
      But it said that total operating profits, including own
  account trading, rose 24.9 pct or 4.5 pct without the Flick
  transaction in the group, and 35.1 pct or seven pct in the
  parent bank.
      Banking analysts said this put group total operating
  profits at some 6-1/2 to seven billion marks, and parent bank
  operating profits at over five billion marks.
      Christians said Deutsche used the extraordinary earnings
  from Flick to pay a record five mark bonus on top of its
  unchanged 12 mark dividend.
      The bank had decided against raising the dividend itself
  because of the uncertain business outlook at the end of 1986,
  and developments so far this year showed that was correct,
  Christians said.
      West German banks rarely raise dividends unless they are
  sure they can maintain the increased payout in subsequent
  years, preferring to use bonuses for one-of profits.
      The bank also used its extraordinary earnings to continue a
  high level of risk provision, Christians said.
      Disclosed group risk provisions rose to 867 mln marks in
  1986 from 765 mln in 1985.
      Under German law, disclosed provisions do not necessarily
  reflect the full amount of risk provisions.
      Management board joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen said
  Deutsche's total debt exposure to problem countries had fallen
  to over six billion marks in 1986 from 7.4 billion in 1985
  because of the fall in the dollar.
      He agreed with a questioner who asked if over two thirds of
  such problem country debt had been written off.
      Deutsche Bank posted a sharp rise in holdings of ""other
  securities,"" to 4.64 billion marks from 2.71 billion in the
  parent bank.
      Christians said this 1.93-billion-mark rise was partly due
  to its increased activity in international share placements,
  with some shares such as those from Fiat SpA's international
  placement last year remaining on its books.
      Herrhausen said that no concrete measures were planned to
  place these shares and conclude the original placement.

  AG>, the former &lt;European Asian Bank AG>, from
  Creditanstalt-Bankverein &lt;CABV.VI>, Deutsche management board
  joint spokesman Alfred Herrhausen told a news conference.
      Euras broke even in 1986 and required no funding from
  Deutsche, he said. He gave no details of the deal with
  Creditanstalt.
      Press reports that Deutsche was planning a takeover of
  Lloyds Bank plc &lt;LLOY.L> were without foundation, he said.
      Herrhausen said Deutsche had taken part in the recent
  capital increase of &lt;Morgan Grenfell Group plc>, but had no
  plans to raise its 4.4 pct share in Morgan Grenfell.
      &lt;Banca d'America e d'Italia SpA>, in which 98.3 pct was
  acquired from Bankamerica Corp &lt;BAC.N> late last year, would be
  consolidated this year, and contribute to further expansion of
  Deutsche's business, management board joint spokesman F.
  Wilhelm Christians said.
      Following a ruling earlier this year from the Federal High
  Court, Deutsche had included its non-bank holdings in the
  balance sheet section ""participations,"" Christians said.
      But Christians said the bank still regarded shares in these
  non-bank companies as an investment rather than an active
  participation.
      Parent bank total participations rose to 6.45 billion marks
  in 1986 from a comparable 4.57 billion in 1985 including a rise
  to 3.79 billion from 2.34 billion in bank participations.
      Herrhausen said the grouping of holdings in the balance
  sheet in this was was not a first step to floating them off in
  a separate holding company.
  

"
893,1,"SINGAPORE BANKS SAY DIVERSIFICATION KEY TO GROWTH
  Singapore's major banks are
  diversifying and gradually shifting their asset holdings from
  loans to debt instruments, banking sources said.
      The banks following the trend are the &lt;Overseas Union Bank
  Ltd>, &lt;United Overseas Bank Ltd>, &lt;Oversea-Chinese Banking
  Corporation> and the &lt;Development Bank of Singapore Ltd>.
      The shift towards securitisation has been helped by
  volatile financial markets which have developed hedging
  facilities such as floating rate notes and bonds for risk
  management, said Overseas Union General Manager Loh Hoon Sun.
      Loh told Reuters in an interview that Singapore banks see
  limited growth in credit risk. More and more of them are
  switching from term lending to major growth areas such as
  stockbroking and fee based income, he said.
      Major local banks ventured into stockbroking after being
  granted seats on the stock exchange. Bankers said they are now
  moving into the new government securities market and the Stock
  Exchange of Singapore Dealing and Quotation System.
      One foreign banker said the Development Bank and the
  Overseas Union Bank Ltd have become major players in the equity
  market in Singapore.
      Loh said the banks' participation in the stock market has
  increased business transactions and provided long term growth
  for the market. The banks are not competition for individual
  stockbroking firms because of the increased business they
  generate, he added.
      Loh said the Stock Exchange of Singapore might expand
  equity issues by as much as one billion dlrs this year because
  of the increasing ability of foreign and local market
  participants to absorb new issues.
      Loh said &lt;OUB Investment management Ltd>, a subsidiary of
  the Overseas Union Bank Ltd, has teamed up with a U.K. Firm to
  launch the Union Global Fund. The fund is for local investors
  seeking capital growth through a diversified international
  portfolio. It will invest in international shares with the
  emphasis on U.S. And Japanese markets, he said.
      &lt;DBS Securities Singapore Pte Ltd>, a subsidiary of the
  Development Bank of Singapore, has applied to the Hong Kong
  Stock Exchange to set up a Hong Kong stockbroking firm.
      Loh predicted fixed deposit and prime interest rates in
  Singapore will stay low this year. As a result, banks will be
  forced to provide fund management services for major clients
  seeking better returns, he said.
      Economic analysts and bankers are optimistic the major
  banks will show profits in 1987, helped by higher income from
  treasury and investment banking activities.
      They expect the 1987 after-tax profits of Oversea-Chinese
  and United Overseas to show stable growth of four to eight pct
  against respective gains of four and seven pct in 1986.
      Overseas Union's profits are expected to jump to over 40
  mln dlrs from seven mln dlrs in 1986, economists said.
      The Development Bank's after-tax profits rose 39.2 pct in
  1986 mainly due to a dividend of 20.4 mln dlrs paid by
  &lt;National Discount Company Ltd> before it became a subsidiary
  of the bank, they said.

896,2,"C AND W OFFERED ROLE IN NEW JAPAN TELECOM COMPANY
  A Japanese businessman announced plans for
  a new telecommunications firm in which Britain's Cable and
  Wireless Plc would be a core company.
      However, the plan, unveiled by senior Federation of
  Economic Organizations official Fumio Watanabe, does not
  specify what stake Cable and Wireless would have.
      ""The share holdings of the core companies should be equal,""
  Watanabe said in a statement. ""The actual percentage of
  shareholdings should be agreed by the core companies.""
      He said the eight core companies will provide directors for
  the firm.
      ""The new company shall immediately set to work on the
  feasibility study of constructing a new cable for itself,""
  Watanabe said.
      Watanabe has acted as mediator between two rival groups,
  one of which included C and W, seeking to compete against
  &lt;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd>, which now monopolizes Japan's
  overseas telephone business.
      The Post and Telecommunications Ministry has said it wants
  only one competitor to KDD and has backed Watanabe's efforts.
      A British source, who declined to be identified further,
  said the proposals could open the door to further talks between
  C and W &lt;CAWL.L> and the other firms involved.
      C and W had earlier rejected a reported proposal which
  would have given it a five pct share in the new
  telecommunications firm, compared to the less than three pct
  stake Watanabe originally proposed. C and W has a 20 pct stake
  in one of the two firms Watanabe has proposed should merge.
      The British source said the decision not to specify the
  exact shareholdings of the core companies could leave the door
  open for further discussion.
      ""It's probably a sensible approach on their part,"" the
  British source told reuters.
      C and W has also been pushing hard for permission to lay a
  new cable between Japan and the U.S.
      The proposed merger has sparked an international row, with
  British government sources threatening retaliatory action
  against Japan for what they see as discriminatory practices
  against foreign firms.
      The sources said last Friday that one option for Britain
  would be to revoke licenses of Japanese banks and securities
  companies operating in London.
      The U.S. Has also attacked the original merger plans,
  saying that both rival consortia should be licensed.
      Asked about participation by other U.S. And European firms,
  Watanabe said, ""They will not be core companies but if they wish
  they could participate."" Under the Japanese law, total foreign
  participation would be limited to one-third.
      ""It might be wise for C and W to join the new firm which has
  the support of many influential backers and work within this
  for the realization of their ideas,"" Watanabe told reporters.
      The other core firms are Mitsubishi Corp &lt;MITT.T>, Mitsui
  and Co &lt;MITS.T>, Sumitomo Corp &lt;SUMT.T>, Matsushita Electric
  Industrial Co &lt;MC.T>, Toyota Motor Corp &lt;TOYO.T>, C Itoh and Co
  &lt;CITT.T>, and &lt;Pacific Telesis International Inc>.
      Watanabe said that his latest proposal represented his
  final effort.
      If it fails to satisfy the British government, it will be
  up to the Japanese government to explain its position, he said.

899,1,"BAYER CONFIDENT OF POSTING GOOD 1987 RESULTS
  Chemicals group Bayer
  AG &lt;BAYG.F> said it expects to post another good result in 1987
  after raising pre-tax profit to a new record high in 1986.
      The company said that this was despite the mark's further
  strengthening against the dollar and other currencies and
  despite an increase in competitive pressure.
      ""The further progress of our business will depend largely on
  the extent to which threats to free trade materialise and on
  the developments of exchange rates, raw material and energy
  costs.
      Bayer said world group pre-tax profit rose to 3.30 billion
  marks in 1986, exceeding the previous year's record of 3.15
  billion. Parent company pre-tax profit increased to 1.72
  billion from 1.62 billion.
      The company gave no net profit figures or any indication of
  the likely 1986 dividend. Bayer paid a 10-mark dividend on 1985
  results, up one mark from a year earlier.
      Bayer said that world group operating profit declined
  slightly in 1986 against 1985 but non-operating results showed
  a further improvement.
      Bayer said that the decline in world group turnover to
  40.75 billion marks from 45.93 billion in 1985 reflected mainly
  the sharp fall in the dollar against the mark.
      Lower prices on the raw material side had also brought
  pressure on selling prices, it added.
      In volume terms, however, 1986 sales rose slightly against
  1985, the company said without giving details.
      ""The western Europe, North America and Far East regions
  developed well in local currency, but here too the translation
  of local currency sales into marks distorted the picture,
  especially in the case of North America,"" it said.
      Bayer said parent company volume sales were also higher in
  1986, although turnover fell 4.3 pct to 16.77 billion marks.
      Capacity use was high at the parent company in 1986,
  resulting in a decline in marginal unit costs. This, combined
  with savings in raw material and energy costs, helped offset
  falling prices and cost increases in other areas.
      The rise in pre-tax parent company profit was due to lower
  extraordinary expenses and higher net interest income.
  Plastics, organic chemicals, polyurethanes and coating raw
  materials all developed well, it said.
      Turning to the 1986 fourth quarter, Bayer said that world
  group turnover fell to 9.67 billion marks in the last three
  months of 1986 from 10.43 billion in the same 1985 period.
      Parent company turnover in the fourth quarter fell 7.1 pct
  to 3.69 billion marks, with domestic turnover 4.1 pct lower and
  foreign turnover 8.6 pct lower.
      Exports accounted for 65.3 pct of turnover in the quarter
  against 66.4 pct in the same quarter of 1985.

902,2,"COMPROMISE CITED ON SAN MIGUEL SHARES
  &lt;San Miguel Corp>, SMC, and &lt;United
  Coconut Planters Bank>, UCPB, have reached a compromise on a
  disputed block of 38.1 mln shares of SMC, the head of a
  government panel that controls the sequestered shares said.
      Ramon Diaz, Chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good
  Government (PCGG) told Reuters SMC had offered a price of 126
  pesos per share for the block, held in trust by the UCPB.
      ""It looks good,"" Diaz said. But he added several issues,
  including the identity of the ultimate buyers of the shares,
  had to be resolved before the PCGG gave its approval to the
  sale.
      The PCGG's sequestration last year of 33 mln shares aborted
  SMC's bid to buy them back from 14 trading companies in the
  UCPB group. The commission said it suspected the shares were
  actually controlled by Eduardo Cojuangco, an associate of
  former President Ferdinand Marcos.
      Cojuango, who headed the boards of both SMC and UCPB when
  he fled last year after Marcos was toppled, personally owned 24
  mln shares in SMC. His holdings are also under sequestration.
      ""The shares that SMC now proposes to buy from the UCPB are
  owned by 1.4 mln coconut farmers,"" Diaz said. ""Naturally we do
  not want them to go back into the hands of Marcos cronies.""
      PCGG sources said a compromise would end a row over a down
  payment of 500 mln pesos made by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiary
  Neptunia Corp Ltd in a bid to buy back the shares last year.
      The UCPB had said the 500 mln peso payment would be
  forfeited because SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III had failed to
  fulfil his commitment to buy back the shares at an originally
  negotiated price of 3.3 billion pesos.
      PCGG sources said SMC, the Philippines' largest food and
  beverage manufacturer, has agreed to sell 14 mln ""B"" class shares
  from the 38.1 mln shares to Australian brewer Alan Bond at a
  price of 150 pesos per share.
      The PCGG sources said of the proposed 4.79 billion peso
  transaction, 1.6 billion pesos would be offset against the 500
  mln peso down payment, the 500 mln pesos worth of preferred
  shares in UCPB held by SMC, 210 mln pesos in uncollected
  dividends on the UCPB shares and 400 mln pesos advanced to
  UCPB-controlled trading companies.
      The UCPB rejected an original offer of 100 pesos per share
  made by SMC for 33 mln shares, which grew to 38 mln after a 15
  pct stock dividend declared in June last year.
      A spokesman for SMC said the company's 15-member board met
  today to discuss the proposed compromise.
      The spokesman declined comment on the outcome of the board
  meeting, saying the dispute was under arbitration.
      President Corazon Aquino last month asked SMC and UCPB to
  set up a three-man arbitration panel to resolve the ownership
  issue. The panel is due to submit its report by April 15.
      Eduardo de Los Angeles, a government nominee in the SMC
  board, filed a formal complaint before the Securities and
  Exchange Commission last week, accusing Soriano and eight other
  directors of violating ""fiduciary duty.""
      De Los Angeles was said to have opposed a decision by SMC's
  board last December to assume the 500 mln peso Neptunia loan.

  Ranks Hovis McDougall Plc &lt;RHML.L> said
  it was making an increased and final offer for the Avana Group
  Plc &lt;AVNA.L>. The company already holds about 22.9 pct or 7.1
  mln Avana ordinary shares.
      It said in a statement the terms of the offer will be 13
  new Rank Hovis shares for every five Avana ordinary shares,
  valuing each Avana share at 829p.
      Avana shareholders will be entitled to receive and retain
  the net interim dividend of 5.25p per Avana share for the year
  ending 28 March 1987.
      Accepting Avana shareholders will also be entitled to
  receive Ranks Hovis's forecast net interim dividend of 2.65p
  for the financial year ending 5 September 1987.
      Ranks Hovis said that full acceptance of the increased
  offer would result in the issue of a maximum of 72.3 mln new
  Ranks Hovis shares or about 20 pct of the enlarged issued
  ordinary share capital of the company.
      The latest offer will lapse on 17 April. Ordinary
  shareholders in Avana who accept the increased offer will have
  the opportunity to elect for cash for all or part of their
  holdings on the basis of 800p cash for each Avana share.
      Ranks Hovis said the cash required for the cash alternative
  would be met by one of several methods.
      For the first 10 mln Avana shares received opting for the
  cash alternative, Ranks Hovis would make a cash payment from
  its own resources.
      For cash alternatives of more than 10 mln Avana shares,
  Morgan Grenfell, as agent for participants, will make a
  separate offer to purchase at 300p per share, net of expenses,
  up to 46.3 mln Ranks Hovis new shares to which such
  shareholders will be entitled under the increased offer. This
  is equivalent to 780p per Avana ordinary.
      In addition, Ranks Hovis will make a further cash payment
  of 20p per Avana ordinary. Avana shares traded at 800p after
  the announcement, 32p up from last night's close of 768p. REUTER

906,2,"CABLE UNIMPRESSED BY NEW JAPANESE TELECOMS OFFER
  Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> said new
  proposals unveiled by Japan for it to become a core member of a
  merged telecommunications firm to compete for
  telecommunications contracts did not remove the group's
  objections.
      The suggestions by Federation of Economic Organisations
  official Fumio Watanabe was a formal announcement of proposals
  made earlier this week and reported in the Japanese press.
      Cable has a 20 pct stake in one of the two groups trying to
  compete against Japan's &lt;Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd> which
  monopolises Japan's overseas telephone business.
      But a Cable spokesman said it still believed a merger of
  the two consortia would be impracticable. ""They are like oil and
  water,"" he said.
      The Japanese authorities want only one competitor and have
  proposed that the two consortia band together. The issue has
  been taken up by the British government as a test case on the
  openness of Japanese markets. Watanabe's latest proposals said
  that the eight core companies of the new group should have
  equal share holdings but added that they could work out the
  precise percentages amongst themselves.
      The reports earlier this week said that Cable would be
  offered a five pct stake, up from an originally proposed three
  pct.
      Despite the apparent differences in stakes offered, the
  Cable spokesman said the two offers appeared to be essentially
  the same.
      Cable shares at 1100 GMT were quoted nine pence firmer at
  374p.

  parliamentary sources said.
      The government originally intended to float the munitions

  a private sale was a more appropriate way to dispose of the
  firm.
      The bidders for the company were British Aerospace Plc

      Royal Ordnance made pre-tax profits of 26 mln stg on sales

  commercial operation. The company has assets of around 240 mln

  International Technology corp
  said it expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter ended
  March 31 of about 20 cts per share, compared with a
  year-earlier profit of 11 cts.
      The company blamed the expected loss on regulatory and
  permitting issues that limited the full utilization of
  hazardous waste treatment cites in Califoirnia, continued
  startup delays for major remediation projects, the writeoff of
  an investment in a subsidiary and a settlem,ent with the
  California Attorney General's Office and Department of Health
  Services.
      The company said the settlement relates to regulatory
  violations alleged by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agengy
  and the California Health Services department at the company's
  Vine Hill and Panoche treatment facilities in Northern
  California.
      It said under the agreement, it will pay the state
  2,100,000 dlrs in civil penalties over a two-year period and
  pay 500,000 dlrs over five years to local medical facilities as
  part of a community awareness and emergency response program
  developed by local communities.  The expenses will be charged
  against fourth quarter results, it said.
      The company said it has agreed as well to make compliance
  and public safety capital expenditures of about 600,000 dlrs.
      It said it has now received an operating permit for a new
  250,000 cubic yard landfill cell at its Imperial County,
  Calif., from the Health Services department.
      The company said the Panoche facility remains closed but is
  expected to reopen for liquid and sludge receipts in the near
  future.  But it said receipts of solid material, which had
  accounted for the majority of the revenue at the site, could be
  restricted until 1988 pending resolution of capacity issues in
  the Panoche site permit.

  Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale
  &lt;WELG.F> said its wholly-owned Luxembourg subsidiary WestLB
  International SA posted a decline in 1986 net profit to 12.6
  mln marks from 48.5 mln a year earlier.
      WestLB International will pay a 12.5 mln mark dividend to
  WestLB, down from 47.7 mln a year earlier.
      The dividend was lower than in 1985 because the record
  profit of the previous year could not be repeated, due to
  changed market conditions, it said. Increased funds were also
  allocated for provisions. Business in the first three months of
  1987 developed positively, it added.
      WestLB International set aside 115.3 mln marks for
  international credit risks in 1986, up from 97.4 mln marks in
  1985, bringing the total amount of provisions shown in the
  balance sheet to 580.3 mln marks.
      Operating profit fell to 122 mln marks in 1986 from 150 mln
  in 1985. Balance sheet total fell to 9.7 billion marks from
  10.8 billion, reflecting the lower dollar and the fact that
  credit business redemptions were not fully offset by new
  lending.
      The statement said WestLB International's business with
  private customers showed a pleasing expansion last year.
      This development was aided by cooperation between the bank
  and the savings banks in the West German state of North
  Rhine-Westphalia, where parent bank WestLB is based.
      Deposits by non-banks rose more than 40 pct to a total of
  1.1 billion.

925,1,"GE &lt;GE> PROFIT OUTLOOK AIDED BY ENGINE ORDER
  One of General Electric Co's biggest
  businesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasing
  profits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs,
  Wall Street analysts said.
      Previously, it was expected the business would peak and
  decline at some point in the next five years. The improved
  outlook results from AMR Corp's &lt;AMR> decision to order 40 new
  planes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines.
      ""Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order,"" said
  Nicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
      AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements
  for its order of 15 Boeing Co &lt;BA> and 25 &lt;Airbus Industrie>
  twinjet long distance aircraft.
      But AMR said it was using ""rent-a-plane leases"" that allow
  it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt
  structure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the
  planes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects
  AMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe
  downturn in the economy.
      From GE's point of view the package looks like a good deal
  for several reasons, Heymann said.
      GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of
  delivery, Heymann noted.
      And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes
  GE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc,
  would have little trouble rounding up another airline that
  wanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the deal
  appears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said.
      GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by
  midafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham
  and Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company ""no one
  order will have much of an effect on the stock.""
      Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said the
  order ""will help to maintain a good level of production and
  profitability in the aircraft engine business"" for GE.
      Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet engine
  business rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs
  by 1991.
      Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last
  year, with well over half of the business in the military
  sector, according to analysts' estimates.
      The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincides
  with an upbeat performance in other segments.
      Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first
  quarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results,
  he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp
  that it has a ""unique ability"" to buy a major business and
  reshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other
  elements of its 14 business areas.
      Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current
  quarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by the
  NBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates.
      Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in part
  crediting ""significant benefits from the RCA acquisition.""

  to 65 mln dlrs or 2.13 to 2.15 dlrs a share.
      The company also said it intends to reduce its second
  quarter common stock dividend to 35 cts a share from 69 cts.
      Mellon said it will make a provision for loan losses in the
  first quarter of 175 mln dlrs, reflecting about 95 mln dlrs in
  charge-offs and 80 mln dlrs in additions to the loan-loss
  reserve.
      It will also put 310 mln dlrs in Brazilian loans on a cash
  basis, resulting in interest reversals of 10 mln dlrs.
      In the first quarter of 1986, Mellon earned 60.4 mln dlrs
  or 2.13 dlrs a share.
      Chairman David Barnes said the loan charge-offs and
  increased provisions address four areas of concern in the
  bank's wholesale lending portfolio - the energy sector,
  developing countries, some basic industrial companies and
  several commercial real estate businesses.
      Mellon said the loan loss reserve at the end of the first
  quarter is estimated to be 575 mln dlrs, or about 2.5 pct of
  the loan book, compared with 493.8 mln dlrs or 2.17 pct of
  total loans at the end of 1986.
      Mellon said its primary capital ratio at the end of the
  first quarter will be in line with the end-1986 figure of 7.23
  pct, well in excess of regulatory guidelines.
      Non-performing loans at quarter-end are estimated at 1.45
  billion dlrs, or 6.5 pct of the loan portfolio, compared with
  928 mln dlrs or 3.94 pct at the end of 1986.
      Barnes noted that Mellon has a bigger involvement in
  energy-based lending than many other banks. Because of the lack
  of a substantial recovery in energy prices this year,
  especially in natural gas prices, it was felt prudent to
  increase reserves and take losses on loans in this sector.
      ""This action relates both to loans to companies directly
  involved in energy, as well as loans to real estate developers,
  home builders and financial institutions in the Southwestern
  United States,"" Barnes said.
      As for LDC loans, he said Mellon had removed about 80 mln
  dlrs in fully current Argentine loans from cash basis but had
  charged off about 20 mln dlrs in private-sector Mexican debt.
      He said Mellon, which was ordered in December to quit
  Brazil because of its refusal to renew some short-term credit
  lines, expects to participate in efforts to helpt Brazil and
  other sovereign borrowers to reschedule their debts.
      Loans to basic industries were not major contributors to
  the increase in non-performing assets or to first-quarter
  charge offs, but Mellon said it remains concerned about the
  absence of a strong recovery in steel and related industries.
      The increase in reserves, the dividend cut and continued
  management cost-cutting are aimed at ensuring that Mellon has
  the financial strength to deal with current uncertainties,
  Barnes said.
      ""We cannot predict when the uncertainties that presently
  trouble us will end, but we are confident we are managing them
  aggressively,"" he added.

  The specialty retailing area continues
  to pay off for F.W. Woolworth Co, once known only as a five and
  dime store chain, which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct.
      It was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases for
  the New York-based retailer which was founded over 100 years
  ago.
      Woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrs
  per share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrs
  per share. Revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion compared
  with the prior year's 5.96 billion.
      For the fourth quarter, the company reported profits rose
  10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with
  1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share.
  Revenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs.
      Roy Garofalo, Woolworth vice president, told Reuters that
  income generated by the company's specialty store operations
  accounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits.
      He said the company now has 4,700 specialty stores
  operating under 30 different names. Woolworth plans to open 650
  more specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year, it
  operated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said.
      Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by
  Woolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richman
  apparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chain
  of discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discount
  drug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies,
  which sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700
  Woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, of
  which 1,200 are in the United States.
      Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive of Woolworth,
  said in a statement, ""These results are especially gratifying as
  they are an improvement over last year's record earnings.""
      Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings in
  each quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlier
  period.
      Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the
  1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount store
  industry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's, Woolworth
  opened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam,
  a discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the United
  States, although Woolco still operates in Canada.
      In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy and
  announced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time,
  the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores.
  Specialty stores generally have higher sales per square foot
  than general merchandise stores.

964,1,"GERMAN CHEMICAL INDUSTRY SEES LOWER PROFITS
  West Germany's chemical
  industry fears mounting risks will hurt earnings but hopes 1987
  turnover will stabilize around 1986's 140 billion marks, Josef
  Strenger, a board member of the industry association VCI, said.
      Strenger, management board chairman of Bayer AG &lt;BAYG.F>,
  told a news conference at the Hanover trade fair the main
  dangers were stagnation in world trade, the lower dollar as
  well as crude oil and commodity prices.
      Prospects of higher operating costs were also seen harming
  earnings, he said. Turnover took a considerable downturn at the
  start of 1987 after falling 5.9 pct in 1986.
      The chemical industry, which relies heavily on exports, was
  badly hit by mark appreciation in 1986 and lower turnover was
  mainly due to foreign exchange losses, Strenger said.
      Exports fell 6.4 pct to 72 billion marks in 1986 and
  competition from U.S. And British firms increased. Savings from
  lower oil and commodity prices were eaten up by price
  competition and increased costs.
      Strenger said 1986 operating profits of German chemical
  firms were slightly worse than the year before but the improved
  financial and balance sheet structure, after three good years,
  neutralized the negative impact.
      Strenger said the industry would try to increase production
  in the U.S. To make up for lost export possibilities out of
  West Germany.
      The lower dollar was the main reason for an 8.3 pct fall in
  exports to North America, an 11.4 pct drop to Latin America and
  22.6 pct plunge to the Middle East.
      Exports to Western Europe eased 3.5 pct and Far East
  exports, due to an economic revival in Japan, dropped 5.2 pct.
      Strenger noted that the industry had lost public confidence
  following several cases of chemical pollution of the Rhine late
  last year.

"
969,2,"TALKING POINT/SANTA FE SOUTHERN &lt;SFX>
  Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp may have
  more difficulty combining its two railroads than fending off a
  possible takeover by Henley Group &lt;HENG>, which has accumulated
  almost a five pct stake in the real estate and railroad
  conglomerate, analysts said.
      Takeover speculation has surrounded Santa Fe since Henley
  disclosed its stake in the company earlier this week, but
  analysts and a Santa Fe official were skeptical a takeover is
  its intention.
      Analysts also said the company has strong defenses that
  would easily deter any suitor - one of those being its problems
  combining its two railroad properties, which hang in regulatory
  limbo.
      Richard Fischer of Merrill Lynch and Co Inc said that Santa
  Fe at December 31 had 580 mln dlrs in cash and cash
  equivalents, while its long-term debt to capital was just over
  25 pct. ""This gives them plenty of borrowing power,"" he said,
  which could be used against an unwanted suitor.
      Henley Group's Chairman Michael Dingman has said he wants
  to take major positions in undervalued natural resource
  companies. He also told Reuters in an interview he is seeking
  an acquisition of from two billion to eight billion dlrs.
      Santa Fe officials don't appear concerned that Henley might
  launch a takeover. ""I would not characterize the atmosphere
  around here as one of concern,"" one Santa Fe executive said
  about Henley.
      ""I think it's wrong to assume Dingman has formed a firm
  strategy with Santa Fe,"" said Mark Hassenberg, who covers
  Henley for DLJ Securities.
      Analysts say the potential of Santa Fe's land assets are
  likely to be realized slowly. They add that Santa Fe's efforts
  to merge its two railroads remain in regulatory limbo,
  sidetracking many of its strategic plans for the foreseeable
  future.
      These realities, they said, support the Henley Group's
  statement that its Santa Fe stake is only an investment.
      The more pressing problem facing Santa Fe is overcoming
  difficulties in merging its two railroads, the Atchison, Topeka
  and Santa Fe Railway Co and Southern Pacific Transportation Co.
  The merger would create the nation's second-longest railroad.
      Last July the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) denied
  the merger on anticompetitive grounds.
      The company since has granted trackage-sharing rights to
  four western railroads to meet the ICC's concerns and persuade
  it to reopen the hearings in its three-year-old struggle to
  merge the lines.
      ""My guess is the commission will decide in three to six
  weeks whether to reopen hearings,"" Fischer said.
      ""I believe they've made an effort to satisfy the ICC's
  objections,"" he said. ""But in doing so they haven't pleased
  everyone. Before they had Burlington Northern on their side,
  now Burlington is opposed to the way trackage rights are set
  up.""
      If the hearings are reopened, analysts predicted it will
  take six to nine months for everyone to have their say, and up
  to another year for the ICC to decide.
      Santa Fe is in the midst of a 50-mln-share stock buyback
  program begun in 1984. It has bought back 33.7 mln shares as of
  February 1, when it had 154.7 mln shares outstanding, a
  spokesman said.
      Among the shares repurchased were two stakes owned by
  Norfolk Southern, one of 3.4 mln shares bought in 1986 and
  another of 1.7 mln shares in 1985, one analyst said.
      James Voytko at Paine Webber believes Santa Fe could fight
  off the Henley Group with its cash and credit. Citing the share
  buybacks from Norfolk Southern, he said one of Santa Fe's
  options, if threatened, could be to buy the Henley stake.
      ""It is indeed possible that Dingman sees this as a
  low-risk, opportunistic investment,"" Voytko said.
      ""People who follow Santa Fe have given me values of 45 dlrs
  to 50 dlrs a share,"" said DLJ Securities' Hassenberg. ""But I'm
  certain that in Dingman's mind, the company is worth more than
  that in breakup value.""

985,1,"WESSANEN FORESEES STRONG PROFIT GROWTH
  Dutch dairy and general foods
  manufacturer Koninklijke Wessanen NV &lt;WESS.AS>, said it is
  planning further world-wide acquisitions and forsees strong
  profit growth over the next 10 years.
       Company chairman Gerrit van Driel told journalists at the
  presentation of Wessanen's 1986 report he already expected 1987
  first quarter profits to show an increase.
      The company last month reported a 16 pct increase in 1986
  net profits to 72.7 mln guilders, after 62.3 mln in 1985.
      This was achieved despite a 25 pct drop in the dollar's
  guilder value, van Driel said.
      Van Driel said profits would have been nine mln guilders
  higher if the US currency had remained at its average 1985
  level of 3.20 guilders.
      Turnover, at 3.7 billion guilders in 1986, was 450 mln
  guilders down because of the lower dollar and lower raw
  material prices. Total 1985 turnover was 4.2 billion guilders.
      US activities accounted for 34 pct of 1986 turnover,
  compared with 22 pct in 1982. Wessanen now has 15 separate
  businesses in the US out of a total of 62 world-wide.
      Van Driel said the company would continue an active
  takeover policy in the US, but would be wary about paying more
  than its current price/earnings ratio of 17 times net profit.
      He added that Wessanen teams were seeking acquisition
  possibilities in Brazil, Taiwan, Thailand and China.
      He said the company had an ample cashflow of 100 mln
  guilders and would if necessary make new share issues.
      Van Driel said he expected a 1987 US turnover of 700 mln
  dlrs. He said &lt;Balanced Foods> and &lt;Green's Dairy>, taken over
  late last year, have a combined annual turnover of 126 mln dlrs
  which was not included in the 1986 account.
      All sectors saw strong growth in 1986, resulting in a 13
  pct increase in operating income to 120 mln guilders. Key to
  this growth was the successful introduction of new products,
  which were greatly enhanced by a number of consumer-oriented US
  acquisitions, van Driel said.
      Consumer products represented 50 pct of total 1986
  turnover, compared with 35 pct in 1982, van Driel said.
      The company, which is already listed on the London, Zurich,
  Basle and Geneva stock exchanges as well as Amsterdam, aims to
  be quoted in Frankfurt and Dusseldorf in May, van Driel said.
      Van Driel stressed that while these listings would not be
  accompanied by new share issues, they provided easy vehicles
  for the company to raise capital for future expansion.
      He estimated that 33 pct of the company's shares were in
  foreign hands.
      The company's 1986 US turnover of about 750 mln dlrs made a
  listing on one of the New York exchanges a logical next step,
  van Driel said without elaborating.
      Despite EC dairy restrictions Wessanen, which produces
  around 10 pct of all Dutch cheese, saw good growth prospects
  for its dairy sector within Europe, van Driel said.

1004,1,"TIME &lt;TL> 1987 EARNINGS MAY BE 4.25 DLRS SHARE
  Time Inc's chief financial officer,
  Thayer Bigelow, told security analysts the company is
  ""comfortable"" with Wall Street estimates that 1987 earnings
  will be in a range of 3.75 dlrs to 4.25 dlrs per share.
      In 1986, Time reported earnings of 5.95 dlrs per share,
  including a number of special items.
      Bigelow said in adjusting the 1986 results for the special
  items and also removing the earnings of American Television and
  Communications Corp &lt;ATCMA>, Time earned 2.35 dlrs per share in
  1986.
      Turner Broadcasting System Inc said the investment by the
  cable consortium would be in Turner Broadcasting, not directly
  in CNN. The consortium would infuse up to 550 mln dlrs in
  Turner Broadcasting in return for a 35 pct equity interest.
      Ted Turner, Chairman, would retain a 51 pct interest, a
  Turner Broadcasting spokesman said.
      Bigelow said the company is continuing its previously
  announced 10 mln share repurchase program and has bought back
  4.1 mln of its own shares. He said 700,000 shares were
  purchased in the first quarter of 1987 at an average price of
  81 dlrs per share.
      Bigelow said the company will always have a share buyback
  program in place whenever it believes it is a better long-term
  investment than starting or acquring a business. But he did not
  give any specifics on further repurchases beyond the 10 mln
  shares already announced.
     
      On the subject of acquisitions, Richard Munro, chairman and
  chief executive said the company is not interested in investing
  in over-the-air broadcasting, but continues to look at all
  areas in which it is currently engaged.
      Munro said book publishing is an area that interested Time.
  In 1986 the company purchased Scott and Foresman, its biggest
  acquisition ever.
      N.J. Nicholas, president and chief operating officer, said
  the company might be interested in a relatively small book
  business.
      He said following the recent agreement for the sale of
  Harper and Row to the News Corp Ltd &lt;NWS>, ""there may be pieces
  that Murdoch doesn't want,"" referring to News Corp chairman
  Rupert Murdoch.
      Asked if the company's SAMI business is for sale, Munro
  said it is a ""delicate subject"", and ""we're looking at all the
  options."" SAMI is a marketing information service for the food
  industry. Published reports have stated it could be worth as
  much as 500 mln dlrs.
     
      Bigelow said that Time's Home Box Office added  subscribers
  last year and the trend is continuing in the first quarter of
  1987. However, he said, HBO's results in the quarter will be
  down slightly, but in the first quarter of 1986 there was a
  special gain in the HBO unit.
      Nicholas said that HBO and Cinemax had combined subscriber
  growth of 800,000 for last year.
      He also said the tax rate in 1987 will remain at just under
  50 pct because of the repeal of investment tax credits and
  higher state and local taxes. He said he sees a decrease in the
  tax rate in 1988 of five or six percentage points.
      Munro said the company does not plan to increase its
  dividend.
      Trygve Myhren, chairman and chief executive of American
  Television and Communications, said the unit is looking at
  getting involved in the home shopping video area. ""It would be
  foolish not to be a player there,"" he said.
      He said the company had talks with Home Shopping Network
  Inc &lt;HSN> prior to that company's public offering last year,
  but nothing came of the talks.

1005,2,"GOODYEAR &lt;GT> CHAIRMAN CRITICIZES CORPORATE RAIDS
  The chairman of Goodyear Tire and Rubber
  Co, a concern that survived a recent hostile takeover bid,
  charged that ""terrorists in three-piece suits"" are undermining
  the nation's industrial base.
  In a speech to a meeting of south Florida business executives,
  Goodyear Chairman Robert Mercer lashed out at corporate raiders
  and takeover specialists, accusing them of causing serious harm
  to the companies they target.
    ""Their interest is not in preserving and strengthening
  America's industrial and providing jobs,"" he said. ""Their
  product is simply deals, and that is not a product which a
  country ... can base a future on.""
      Last year, Mercer fought off a takeover attempt by British
  industrialist Sir James Goldsmith.
      But Goodyear's independence was preserved at a high price,
  Mercer said.
      The company bought back Goldsmith's stock for 620 mln dlrs,
  giving him a 93 mln dlr profit. Goodyear also paid him 37 mln
  dlrs for expenses and bought about 41 mln other shares for over
  two billion dlrs.
      In an effort to trim its new debt, Goodyear closed down
  three plants Mercer believes otherwise could have been saved,
  sold its motor wheel and aerospace units and reduced its
  payroll by 10 pct, he said.
      Mercer, who plans to testify tomorrow at a Senate hearing
  on a proposed bill to control corporate raiders, said hostile
  takeovers have also hurt workers.

      Supermarkets is best known for its Pathmark chain of
  supermarket drug stores in the New York and New Jersey area and

  last year made a bid for California-based Safeway Stores Inc.

1046,2,"SEC CLARIFIES POSITION ON TENDER OFFER CHANGES
  The Securities and Exchange
  Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for
  the shares of companies that they must extend the period their
  offers are open if key conditions are changed.
      Specifically, the agency said those making tender offers
  for companies' stock must extend the offers if they decide to
  eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be
  tendered in order for the offers to be valid.
      Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions.
  As a result, a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares
  that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached.
      In an interpretation of current rules, which officials said
  clarifies the SEC's present position, the agency said a tender
  offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived,
  even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so.
      The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share
  condition is a ""material change"" of the tender offer under U.S.
  securities law, SEC officials said.
      The SEC has already said that other specific material
  changes, such as changes in the percentage of securities being
  sought or the price being offered, made during the course of a
  tender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer.
      The length of the extension, which is aimed at giving
  shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender
  offer, was not specified in cases where the minimum share
  conditions were waived.
      SEC officials said the length of the extension in such
  cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding
  each case, but would generally be between five and 10 days.
      The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers
  of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each
  offer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the new
  information. Officials declined to identify the two offers.
      ""If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of
  its offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate
  dissemination,"" the SEC said.
      Federal securities law requires that all tender offers
  remain open for at least 20 business days.

  stock could be exchanged for 8.50 dlrs in market value of

  Time Inc said the acquisition of Scott,

      For the first quarter the acquisition will have a negative
  impact of about 20 cts per share, chief financial officer
  Thayer Bigelow told security analysts.
      He said Scott, Foresman, a textbook publisher, will
  contribute more than 50 mln dlrs in operating income before
  depreciation and amortization for the full year.
      N.J. Nicholas, president and chief operating officer, said
  Soctt Foresman will have over 200 mln dlrs in revenue in 1987.
      Bigelow said the textbook business, which normally has its
  highest profit in the third quarter and incurs a loss in the
  first quarter, will have an ""adverse impact of 15 mln dlrs' on
  book publishing income for the first quarter.
      ""First quarter performance for the rest of Time Inc will be
  better than last year,"" Bigelow said.
      The dilution of 17 cts per share for 1987 includes the
  effects of financing the acquisition. Bigelow also said the
  company is ""comfortable"" with estimates that earnings will be
  between 3.75 dlrs and 4.25 dlrs per share for the year.

1106,1,"GULF STATES (GSU) SEES END TO CASH BY MAY
  Gulf States Utilities Co said
  its condition has ""significantly deteriorated"" and that its
  operating cash reserves will be inadequate by May 1987 unless
  it receives additional financing or rate relief from state
  public utilities commissions in Texas and Louisiana.
      In the company's newly-released annual report and 10-K
  filing, Gulf States said its bank lenders had notified the
  utility last month that no additional credit would be granted.
  Gulf States said the banks had requested the utility to begin
  making prepayments by the end of April of 45 mln dlrs more than
  the estimated 1987 lease payments of 40 mln dlrs.
      ""The circumstances increase the likelihood that the company
  may have to seek protection from its creditors under the
  bankruptcy code,"" Gulf States said.
      The utility had previously said it might be forced to
  consider filing for bankruptcy because of limited rate
  increases granted by state regulators in connection with Gulf
  States' 4.3 billion dlr River Bend nuclear plant in Louisiana.
      ""If the regulatory commissions approve the company's
  proposed rate moderation plan and grant the increases provided
  for in such plan during the initial three-year phase-in period,
  the company believes it could achieve financial stability,""
  Gulf States said.
      In February, the Texas Public Utilities Commission granted
  Gulf States an interim rate increase of 39.9 mln dlrs
  contingent upon the utility obtaining a new 250 mln dlr line of
  credit to pay operating expenses. The utility had sought 144.1
  mln dlrs in rate hikes in Texas.
      Gulf States has appealed a decision by Louisiana state
  regulators rejecting its application for 100 mln dlrs in
  emergency rate relief.
      In 1986, Gulf States earned 244.9 mln dlrs on revenues of
  1.47 billion dlrs, compared to profits of 265.4 mln dlrs on
  sales of 1.85 billion in the previous year.

1108,1,"CAESARS WORLD BOARD APPROVES RECAPITALIZATION
  Caesars World Inc &lt;CAW> said its
  directors unanimously approved a recapitalization plan under
  which stockholders will get a cash distribution of 25 dlrs per
  share via a one-time special cash dividend and will retain
  their common stock ownership in Caesars World.
      Caesars World said it expects to raise the approximately
  one billion dlrs needed to pay the 25 dlr per share dividend
  and the expenses of recapitalization through around 200 mln
  dlrs in bank borrowings and a public sale of approximately 800
  mln dlrs of debt. Some outstanding debt will be retired.
      Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, Caesars' financial advisor, has
  told the company it is confident it can arrange the entire
  financing needed for the recapitalization.
      Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer of the
  hotel, casino and resorts company, said in a statement the
  board believes the recapitalization plan is financially
  superior to a 28 dlr a share tender offer by Martin Sosnoff.
      Gluck said the Caesars World board once again recommends
  that shareholders reject the Sosnoff offer.
      The stock closed at 29.25 dlrs a share on Friday.
      ""Our ability to restructure along these lines is possible
  primarily because of the financial stability and the strong
  operating results achieved by management in recent years,"" Gluck
  said.
      He said that after the recapitalization takes effect,
  proforma net income for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1988 is
  expected to be about 28.7 mln dlrs.
      Fiscal 1988 primary earnings per share are projected to be
  76 cents, based on about 37.8 mln in post-recapitalization
  common and common-equivalent shares outstanding.
      Commenting on the company's longer term earnings outlook,
  Gluck said ""we project net income to increase to 86.2 mln dlrs
  in 1992, reflecting increased operating income and lower
  interest expense due to the retirement of 267 mln dlrs of debt
  incurred in connection with the recapitalization.""
      He said the company does not usually release projections,
  but has done so now beause of the significance of the
  recapitalization.
      Gluck said the recapitalization plan will be submitted for
  stockholder approval at a special meeting expected in June.
      The plan will require the approval of stockholders and that
  of the Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulatory authorities.
      As part of the plan, the company will change its state of
  incorporation from Florida to Delaware by means of a merger of
  Caesars World into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company.
      The new incorporation certificate and bylaws will provide
  for, among other things, a ""fair price"" provision requiring that
  certain transactions with interested 15 pct stockholders be
  approved by an 80 pct vote of stockholders, excluding shares
  held by such interested stockholders.
      Caesars World said in a statement that ""the cash
  distribution will result in a substantial deficit in
  stockholders' equity."" It did not give an estimate of the size
  of this deficit.
      But the company said its financial advisors have said they
  believe that after the recapitalization, Caesars World should
  have the financial flexibility and resources necessary to
  finance its current and projected operating and capital
  requirements.

  oil and gas producer &lt;TMOC Resources Ltd> in a counter-bid to
  the previously reported takeover offer by Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>.
      The offer values TMOC shares at 4.75 dlrs each, based on
  AGL's closing price of 8.50 dlrs on Friday. TMOC shares jumped
  to 4.60 dlrs on the announcement from its Friday closing price
  of 4.15.
      The AGL offer, the third to be made for TMOC this year,
  compares with the Santos cash offer of 4.00 dlrs a share.
      Based on TMOC's issued capital of 62.08 mln shares, the AGL
  offer values the entire company at 249.9 mln shares.
      AGL said in a statement that it already holds 10.5 pct of
  TMOC's issued capital. This compares with the Santos stake of
  3.1 pct when it announced its bid in March 23.
      &lt;Elders Resources Ltd> began the auction for TMOC about
  three months ago with an unsuccessful 2.55 dlrs a share
  on-market offer that has since lapsed.
      AGL said its offer is above the upper end of the range of
  values placed on TMOC by its advisers in the company's response
  urging rejection of the Elders Resources bid.
      AGL said it will make the same offer for TMOC's convertible
  notes. Accepting share and note holders will participate in
  AGL's planned one-for-one bonus issue.
      It said TMOC is already a partner with AGL in the Alice
  Springs to Darwin gas pipeline and has a number of businesses
  complementary with those of AGL.
      AGL is the New South Wales natural gas utility while TMOC
  has extensive onshore holdings, mainly in Queensland where it
  owns the Moonie oil field and in the Northern Territory where
  it operates and holds 43.75 of the Mereenie oil-gas field. It
  also has interests in a number of gas or oil pipelines.

  businesses of Wormald, comprising some or all of its fire
  protection and security businesses in the Americas and Europe,
  Wormald said in a statement.
      The issue of shares in the New York-based Holmes is
  conditional upon shareholder approval at a general meeting.
      Wormald said its stake will represent 9.99 pct of Holmes'
  existing issued shares and 9.09 pct of the enlarged capital.
      The issue will raise 10.6 mln stg which will be used for

  complementary in terms of both geographical spread and the
  nature of their activities, with Holmes concentrating on
  burglar alarms and Wormald on fire systems.
      Holmes's operations are concentrated in and around New York

  effective April 13.
      Under its merger agreement, Hutton has the right to
  unilaterally terminate the merger agreement under certain
  circumstances, including its receipt of less than 66-2/3 pct of
  Purolator shares or the start of a higher competing tender
  offer, such as Emery's competing 40 dlr per share offer for
  Purolator stock.
      Yesterday, Hutton's PC Acquisition Corp subsidiary extended
  its tender offer, which was to have expired at midnight, for

  pct, of Purolator shares had been tendered and not withdrawn,
  down from an 11.5 pct interest held earlier.
      Emery's bid expires April 28.
      Emery said pending the termination of PC Acquisition's
  merger agreement, PC has released Purolator from an agreement
  not to discuss Emery's acquisition proposal with Emery. Emery
  said as a result it is renewing its request that Purolatr enter
  into merger negotiations with it.
      Emery said if it were to acquire 51 pct of Purolator shares
  or control of the Purolator board, it has agreed not to dispute
  PC Acquisition's right to receive fees that Purolator agreed to
  pay if PC were unsuccessful in acquiring control of Purolator
  due to the acquisition of control by another party.

  all of PC Acquisition's documented expenses in connection with
  the merger agreement up to three mln dlrs and Emery has agreed
  to pay the amounts itself should Purolator fail to do so.

  earned 70 cts a share.
      Marion's stock gained 3-1/4 to 75-1/2.
      At the meeting of pharmaceutical analysts, Marion's
  president Fred Lyons Jr. said Wall Street eanrings estimates of
  1.10-1.15 dlrs a share for fiscal 1987 ""are expected to cause
  even the aggressive side of this range to be 10 to 15 cts low.""
      Lyons said the strong performance in the second half of
  this year will result from the fourth quarter introduction of
  90 mg and 120 mg Cardizem tablets. Analyst Crossen said that
  Cardizem, which treats angina, is also expected to be approved
  for the treatment of hypertension by the end of the year.
      Crossen said ""because Marion is still just a small company,
  the growth of Cardizem is having a big impact on the bottom
  line."" He raised fiscal 1988 earnings estimates to 2.15 dlrs a
  share from his previous estimate of 2.05 dlrs a share.
      ""The company has a broad new product pipeline in the
  industry and as far as I am concerned, it is the most
  innovative company in the business,"" he said.
      For the five years through 1991, Crossen expects Marion to
  have a growth rate of 55 pct.

1165,1,"ROLLS APPROACHES FLOAT WITH PROFITS SET TO RISE
  State-owned engine maker &lt;Rolls Royce
  Plc> launches its prospectus for privatisation tomorrow with
  many analysts forecasting higher profits this year. But it is
  likely to miss contracts to power the proposed &lt;Airbus
  Industrie> A340 aircraft.
      The company's so-called ""pathfinder prospectus"" gives all the
  details of its stock market flotation except for the price at
  which shares will be offered.
      Last month, the company announced that pretax profits rose
  in 1986 to 120 mln stg from 81 mln the year before.
      Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, BZW, sees 155 mln profit
  for 1987.
      Analyst Tim Harris of Phillips and Drew said rising profits
  and a low tax charge would be offset by the fact that Rolls
  operated in a sector which traditionally attracted low ratings.
      Assuming the company was valued at around eight times
  earnings, this would give a selling price valuing it at about
  1.2 billion, though he said the recent good performance of the
  aerospace sector could nudge this figure upwards.
      BZW is currently forecasting a higher sale price at between
  1.5 billion and 1.7 billion.
      The price will be increased by it being likely to have much
  of its debt wiped off by a government anxious to assure the
  company's health when it has to fend for itself. Rolls was
  rescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971.
      When the government announced the sale, it said it would
  inject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250
  mln stg at end-1986 -- into the company.
      Analysts noted this was necessary to ensure Rolls a credit
  rating to match those of its main competitors such as General
  Electric Co &lt;GE.N> and United Technologies Corp's &lt;UTX.N> Pratt
  and Whitney unit.

  Rockwell International Corp
  continues to expect significant improvement in 1987 results,
  despite the somewhate disappointing performance of one of its
  business segments, President Donald Beall told Reuters.
      Rockwell reported net earnings in its first quarter ended
  December 31 of 149.4 mln dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs per share, compared
  to 125.8 mln dlrs, or 84 cts per share a year ago.
      Operating earnings, however, were off about four pct, and
  analysts have attributed the decline to Rockwell's
  Allen-Bradley unit, which has suffered from weakness in the
  industrial automation market.
      ""It is in a soft market now, but we are not concerned. It
  is moving forward with market development and is enhancing
  market share,"" Beall said of Allen-Bradley unit.
      Beall, who was in Los Angeles to address a Technology
  management conference, said first quarter sales for the
  Allen-Bradley unit were flat as compared to a year earlier. He
  said the company does not break out operating earnings by unit
  on a quarterly basis.
      Beall said the recent trend toward cost sharing in the
  research and development phase of government contracts should
  not have a major impact on Rockwell's near-term performance.
      He noted, however, the increasing focus on cost sharing
  could limit technological innovation.
      ""I worry that we are heading into a period of misuse of
  contracting approaches too early in the development stages of
  important military contracts,"" Beall said, adding, ""long-term,
  we have a very serious problem.""
      In addition, Beall told the conference the greatest
  competitive threat to defense contractors is in defense
  electronics, due to the government's attempt to take advantage
  of competitively priced products made outside the U.S.

  (Consolidated-Bathurst Inc) said it

  improvement would be due to good market demand, better product
  prices and high operating capacity, the company said in its
  annual report.
      Consolidated-Bathurst, which reported operating profit of
  104 mln dlrs last year on sales of 2.02 billion dlrs, said its
  joint-venture acquisition of a market pulp mill at Castlegar,
  B.C. last year broadens its product range and will contribute

      The company said it views its near-term prospects with

      It said results from its Bridgewater newsprint mill in the

  packaging divisions.
      Consolidated-Bathurst said the outlook for its Europa
  Carton unit is mixed. It said the effect of trade disputes
  between the United States and the European Economic Community
  on the West German economy and the higher value of the mark may
  lead to increased costs which could not be offset by price

  &lt;British Columbia
  Resources Investment Corp>, earlier reporting higher full year
  operating losses, said it reached agreement in principle with
  five lenders providing for a 360 mln dlr credit facility over a
  four year term.
      The company said the credit facility is extendable under
  certain circumstances, with annual principal payments of five
  mln dlrs. The agreement is subject to certain lender approvals
  and completion of formal documentation.
      It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary items
  rose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs.
      B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2
  preferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remain
  suspended.
      However, payment will be made on account of the quarterly
  dividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company's
  trustee from a deposit account, B.C. Resources said.
      Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of
  the March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred
  shareholders, with payment expected in early April to
  shareholders of record March 31, the company said.
      If future dividends are not declared after the April
  exchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment will
  depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast
  Transmission Co &lt;WTC>, B.C. Resources said.
      The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year
  operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a
  four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British
  Columbia.
      B.C. Resources also recorded a 99.9 mln dlr extraordinary
  loss, which included losses on disposition of North Sea oil and
  gas interests by 67 pct owned &lt;Westar Mining Ltd>.
      B.C. Resources' 1986 extraordinary charge also included a
  writedown of its investment in Westar Petroleum. Gains on the
  sales of Westar Timber's Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and
  Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss, the
  company said.
      The company said the asset sales have eliminated B.C.
  Resources' long term financing commitment in the North Sea and
  exposure to the fluctuating pulp market.
      It also said it cut long term debt in 1986 to 900 mln dlrs
  from 1.3 billion dlrs at year-end 1985, and management changes
  and staff cuts have significantly reduced costs.

1254,1,"WILLIAMS &lt;WMB> HAS 4TH QTR CHARGE
  Williams Cos said a fourth quarter charge
  of 250 mln dlrs from discontinued operations and writedowns
  contributed to a 1986 net loss of 240 mln dlrs or 6.97 dlrs a
  share against earnings of 31.6 mln dlrs or 92 cts in 1985.
      The loss in the quarter was 232.3 mln dlrs or 6.75 dlrs
  against income of 10.7 mln dlrs or 31 cts a year ago. Revenues
  in the quarter fell to 521.1 mln dlrs from 716.9 mln and in the
  year fell to 1.9 billion dlrs from 2.5 billion in 1985.
      Williams also said the previously announced sale of its
  Agrico Chemical Co unit to Freeport-Mcmoran Resource Partners
  Ltd has cleared antitrust review and should close next week.
      The 1987 first quarter will include proceeds from the
  Agrico sale, for 250 mln dlrs cash at closing plus deferred
  payments, and proceeds of 320 mln dlrs from the sale of a stake
  in Peabody Holding Co, completed in January.
      In the 1986 first quarter, Williams reported net of 14.2
  mln dlrs or 41 cts a share on sales of 796.4 mln dlrs.
      Williams said the charges in the current year were related
  to an ongoing restructuring. The company said the restructuring
  moves had improved its balance sheet and improved the outlook
  for future stability and growth in earnings.
      Operating profit at the company's Northwest Pipeline Corp
  unit fell 4.5 pct to 150 mln dlrs from lower sales. The
  Williams Natural Gas unit had operating profit of 50.5 mln dlrs
  compared to 90.9 mln dlrs on lower sales volumes.
      Profit at Williams Gas Marketing rose to 26 mln dlrs from
  about 22 mln and the William Pipe Line Co had operating profit
  of 49.4 mln dlrs versus 63.6 mln dlrs a year ago.

  Nacco Industries Inc said it will
  report a gain in the second quarter of about 11.5 mln dlrs or
  1.25 dlrs a share from the sale of stock of a subsidiary.
      Nacco said its North American Coal Corp unit has received
  notice that Consolidation Coal Co, a unit of Du Pont Co &lt;DD>,
  will exercise an option to buy all of the stock of Quarto
  Mining Co, a subsidiary of North American Coal.
      For the stock, North American Coal will receive about 15.2
  mln dlrs, 5.2 mln of which will be paid at closing April 10 and
  the rest in installments, the company said.
      In addition, Quarto will pay a dividend to North American
  Coal of about 10 mln dlrs from retained earnings before
  closing. The funds were previously used to finance mining
  operations.
      Consolidation Coal got the option from the Capco Group of
  utilities, which received the option from Nacco in 1981.
      Nacco reported earnings of 10.8 mln dlrs or 1.11 dlrs a
  share in last year's second quarter.
      In 1986, Quarto generated 5.9 mln dlrs in net income, equal
  to 62 cts a share, of Nacco's total 1986 earnings of 3.48 dlrs
  a share.
      Quarto produced about 3.6 mln short tons of the 24.3 mln

  about 20 mln dlrs over net loan-charge-offs of about 35 mln
  dlrs. It said the provision will increase loan losses to about

      RepublicBank, with total assets of about 21 billion dlrs,

  prior to the buyout.
      The suit contends that this fee hampers Allegheny's ability

      The suit requests an injunction against proceeding with the

  branch in Frankfurt opened and that the bank was considering
  opening a branch in London.
      Luckey said the bank's total operating profits rose nearly
  29 pct in 1986. Parent bank net profit rose to 47.7 mln from
  42.2 mln and the dividend remained unchanged at 12 marks.
      The group balance sheet, including for the first time
  VereinWest Overseas Finance (Jersey), rose 9.2 pct to 17.9
  billion marks, Luckey said.
      The parent bank balance sheet rose 89 mln marks to 13.2
  billion, while business volume was almost unchanged at 14.8
  billion. Credit volume eased to 9.1 billion from 9.2 billion
  while loans to companies rose seven pct.
      Foreign business and securities trading turnover also
  increased. Higher earnings from trading on the bank's own
  account contributed to record operating profits.
      Net interest income rose on firmer interest margins by 16.1
  mln marks to 381.6 mln. Net commission income rose 6.6 mln to
  156.7 mln, Luckey said.
      Foreign commercial business was influenced by a fall in

      The company said it will make the proposal to shareowners
  at its annual mmeting May 6 in Dothan, Ala., near the company's
  Great Southern Paper division operations.
      In conjunction with the stock split proposal, the
  shareowners will be asked to approve an increase in the
  authorized common stock from 60 mln to 150 mln shares, the
  company said.
      The company said it will propose an increase in its
  dividend rate if the split is approved effective with the June
  payment.
      The company said the present rate on GNN common is 43 cts
  per share. The company said it would recommend a quarterly rate
  of 23 cts a share on the split stock. This would be equal to a
  dividend of 46 cts a share on the present common, seven pct
  higher than the current rate.
      The company said it had increased the dividend by 13 pct
  last December. Great Northern Nekoosa's last common stock
  split, a three-for-two, was in December 1983, it said.

1331,2,"OUTBOARD MARINE &lt;OM> RISING ON TAKEOVER RUMOR
  Wall Street traders said the stock of
  Outboard Marine Corp was rising on a rumor over a cable
  television program that Outboard is a likely takeover target of
  Sun Chemical Corp &lt;SNL>.
      Outboard was up 3-1/8 to 34-5/8. On Tuesday it rose 1-3/8
  to 31-1/2 Tuesday.
      A report on Cable News Network today said Sun Chemical has
  4.9 pct of Outboard and is conducting a study on whether to go
  for control of the whole company.
      An Outboard Marine spokesman would not comment on the
  rumor.
      The cable program said a buyout of Outboard would be for up
  to 40 dlrs a share, or for a total of 680 mln dlrs.
      A spokesman for Sun Chemical was not immediately available.
      Outboard Marine last June adopted a shareholder rights plan
  that will be triggered when a person or group acquires
  beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of its common or begins
  a tender offer that would result in 30 pct ownership.
      Wayne Jones, vice president at Outboard for strategic
  planning, said management wants to stay independent. ""We are
  not trying to sell the company. We are proceeding with our
  strategic plans,"" he said.
      That plan includes integrating five boat companies that
  Outboard Marine has bought since the middle of December. Jones
  said all five will cost between 100 mln dlrs to 120 mln dlrs.
      An analyst who wanted anonymity said 40 dlrs a share is a
  ""decent"" price for outboard. ""A bdding war to 50 or 60 dlrs a
  share is stretching it. Maybe 45 dlrs a share tops,"" he said.
      Outboard, which has 17 mln shares outstanding, is in
  registration for a two mln common share offering with Morgan
  Stanley Inc. It makes sense, the analyst said, for Sun Chemical
  to strike before the offering is underway.

1359,1,"TALKING POINT/GENERAL MOTORS &lt;GM>
  General Motors Corp staged an explosive
  rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced
  yesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded by
  stiff competition and erosion of market share.
      GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts
  agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they 
  differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects.
      ""I'm very positive on GM,"" said Jack Kirnan of Kidder
  Peabody and Co. ""They're clearly committed to enhancing
  shareholder value.""
      However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the
  buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to
  recapture lost market share.
      After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy
  back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The
  announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares,
  with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.
      The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the
  stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at
  least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a
  good performance expected from new car models.
      But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the
  repurchase program is not a positive.
      ""The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and
  puts more stress on the balance sheet,"" he said, since GM will
  have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock
  should settle back down to around 76, he added.
      Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and
  5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs.
  Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates,
  which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four
  dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.
      Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domestic
  car and truck market falling in 1987. ""On balance, GM cars are
  not selling as well as their competitors,"" he said.
      In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the
  year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and
  Chrysler Corp &lt;C> both posted increases. But GM said February
  sales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects
  improvement in coming months.
      Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall
  to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986,
  analysts said. The numbers include imports.
      Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product
  improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the
  fourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback.
      ""GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up
  its sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major
  earnings surprise in the winds,"" he said.
      Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in
  part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning
  5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. ""The company is more
  concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation
  with respect to Ford and Chrysler,"" he said.
      Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currently
  five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than
  its competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash
  dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted.
      But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc
  said U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, if
  successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its
  market share.
      ""I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will
  only curtail losses in market share,"" which will fall to around
  35 pct by 1990, Lucky said.
      Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle
  of the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he
  said results will not improve until 1988.
      ""I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a
  transition year for GM,"" he said.
      Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988
  at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not
  affect 1987 results. ""But the key thing isn't so much what they
  earn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that's
  important.""

"
1366,1,"TOTAL STILL EXPECTS 1.5 BILLION FRANC 1986 LOSS
  French oil group Total Cie Francaise des
  Petroles &lt;TPN.PA> is still expecting a 1.5 billion franc
  consolidated net loss, including minority interests, for 1986,
  after taking account of stock losses of 7.5 billion francs, the
  company said in a communique after a board meeting here.
      In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli told
  journalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollar
  had caused the stock depreciation, turning a consolidated net
  profit, before losses on stocks, of six billion francs into a
  consolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs.
      Earlier today Armand Guilbaud, president of Total's
  refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de
  Raffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France &lt;RAFF.PA>, told
  journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the
  subsidiary before stock depreciation.
      CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation and
  currency factors of 1.95 billion francs last year after a 1.16
  billion loss in 1985.
      But its net loss last year, taking account of that
  depreciation as well as currency fluctuations, was 1.16 billion
  francs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985.
      In 1986 CRD's sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from
  20.9 mln ""due to the growth in imports by independent
  distributors following a relaxation of regulations,"" Guilbaud
  said.
      The subsidiary is expecting to cut its workforce to 6,000
  this year and 5,000 in 1988 from 6,800 last year, under a job
  reduction scheme which will eventually save the group 600 mln
  francs, he said.
      Concerning business in 1987, he said that ""January was a
  good month, but the situation deteriorated in February.""

1371,1,"PACTEL &lt;PAC> SEES EARNINGS GROWTH
  Pacific Telesis Group chairman Donald
  Guinn told a meeting of security analysts that the company sees
  continued earnings growth in 1987 above the 1.08 billion dlrs,
  or 5.02 dlrs per share, earned in 1986.
      Guinn also said that capital spending stood at about 1.8
  billion dlrs in 1986, and the company expected the figure to
  remain flat each year through 1989. He noted that all captial
  spending will be internally financed.
      Guinn also told analysts that the company faced some
  regulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its Pacific
  Bell operating company.
      In rates hearings before, the California Public Utility
  Commission, Guinn said the company faced a potential 76 mln dlr
  revenue reduction, and due to ongoing discussions with the
  commission, he said the figure might even be greater.
      The company also faces some opposition to a 225 mln dlr
  rate hike requested for 1986. Guinn said the commission found
  180 mln dlrs of the hike was based on questionable calculations
  and assumptions, while 45 mln dlrs might represented unneeded
  modernization costs.
      Guinn also said that the company is still studying whether
  to join an international consortium that plans to lay a
  transpacific telephone cable between the U.S. and Japan.
      ""We have not agreed to anything,"" Guinn said, but added he
  would soon recieve a feasibility study on the venture and the
  company would make a decision soon on participating.
      Asked by an analyst about the recent recommendation by the
  U.S. Department of Justice which would allow the Bell operating
  companies to offer limited long distance services, Guinn said
  the company would likely shy away from that type of expansion.
      ""(Long distance services) is a very competitive business.
  It's a commodity business and becoming more so,"" he said. ""I'm
  not so sure we would be interested in getting back into that
  business.""
      However, Guinn generally applauded the U.S.
  recommendations, saying they would give more latitude for the
  Bell operating companies to expand into non-regulated
  businesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic
  alliances with other companies.
      He added that while the company welcomes the expansion into
  new areas, it is not currently involved in any acqusition
  talks. ""We do not have anything actively under consideration,""
  he said.

  stock, said it agreed to limit its shareholdings to not more
  than 35 pct of the outstanding shares for a year following the
  company's 1987 annual meeting.
      Dynamics said the CTS board will recommend CTS shareholders
  vote at the 1987 annual meeting in favor of the company paying
  Dynamics 2,178,000 dlrs as a reimbursement for its CTS releated
  costs and granting Dynamics an option to buy enough CTS common
  at 29.625 dlrs a share to give it ownership of 35 pct of the
  outstanding stock.
      Dynamics said the price of stock under the option,
  exercisable for one year, is based on the average closing price
  for the stock for the five days ending March two.
      Dynamics said CTS Chairman George F. Sommer will assume the
  additional title of President. Former President Robert D.
  Hostetler is resigning as a director, as is Chief Financial
  Officer Gary B. Erekson, Ted Ross and Donald J. Kacek.
      Dynamics said the CTS board will be reduced to seven
  members for eight with the remaining four members of the
  current board and three representatives of Dynamics as new

  Trans World Airlines said it has
  proposed a cash merger of USAir Group with TWA in which the
  holders of USAir common would receive 52 dlrs in cash in
  exchange for their stock.
      TWA said the offer was made in a letter to Edmin Colodny,
  chairman and president of USAir.
      TWA said, however, that if the negotiated deal is not
  acceptable it may make an offer directly to USAir's
  shareholders for up to 51 pct of USAir's outstanding stock, to
  be purchased in a voting trust at a price lower than today's
  offer.
      TWA said it is filing an application with the Department of
  Transportation seeking approval of the merger as well as an
  application for approval, on an expedited basis, of its
  purchase of up to 51 pct of USAir common and the deposit of the
  stock in a voting trust, pending DOT approval.
      TWA said that in respect to USAir's recent offer for
  Piedmont Aviation &lt;PIE> it believes that USAir's shareholders
  would prefer a cash merger proposal for USAir over its proposed
  acquisition of Piedmont.
      TWA said, however, it also would be interested in
  discussing a three way deal among USAir, Piedmont and TWA.
      TWA said the merger is subject to the USAir board redeeming
  the preferred stock purchase rights (the poison pill) issued to
  shareholders last year and taking action so that the vote of a
  majority of the outstanding common stock is required to approve
  its proposed move.
      Additionally, TWA said it would need a satisfactory due
  diligence review of USAir.
      TWA said it has not yet had an opportunity to obtain the
  necessary financing for the deal, but added it is confident
  that it will get it.

  earnings ""will probably be off slightly"" from last year's 40
  cts a share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share.
      Douglas said it was too early to project whether the
  anticipated fourth quarter performance would be ""enough for us
  to exceed the prior year's overall earnings"" of 1.53 dlrs a

  wrap up the 3.4 billion dlr acquisition of Viacom International
  Inc in 60 to 90 days.
      Redstone, 63, catapulted himself into the big leagues of
  entertainment early today when a group of Viacom managers and
  their financial backers decided not to top National's bid.
      ""We've had counsel working for some time in every region
  where Viacom has cable televison systems"" Redstone told Reuters
  in a telephone interview.
      Redstone also said ""Viacom is committed to working very
  closely with us to obtain approvals."" Viacom has been seeking
  approvals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cable
  systems since September when its management group first
  advanced a buyout plan.
      But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited bidding
  contest which was capped by the announcement this morning that
  Viacom's independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered into
  a defintive merger agreement with National.
      National is a family business which operates a chain of
  movie theaters. It is dwarfed by Viacom.
      Redstone said he was weary after talks dragged on through
  the night but also excited at the prospect of running a leading
  electronic media company. He noted that the number of motion
  picture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years.
      Of nine satellite television channels operated by Viacom,
  four are motion-picture oriented pay channels. Redstone said
  exclusive contracts with pay television networks are the
  emerging trend. ""Up until recently you could see any motion
  picture on any pay channel,"" Redstone said.
      He noted Viacom has exclusive agreements with two studios
  and plans to sign a deal with a third company next month.
      Redstone said the management group's investment bankers
  will be paid what is due for termination of its merger
  agreement. Such fees could total about 30 mln dlrs. ""That will
  be a company expense,"" Redstone said.
      He said BankAmerica &lt;BAC> Corp has had numerous inquiries
  from lenders who want to participate in a 2.25 billion dlr
  financing for the deal. BankAmerica will provide 592 mln dlrs.
      After the merger, Viacom will be a subsidiary of National
  but 17 pct of the company will be in public hands.

  Southern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortly
  after the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin.
      TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It
  also said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and
  threatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer
  for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price.
      TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for
  USAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said
  it alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the
  airlines.
      Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman
  Carl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into
  the takeover arena.
      ""We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWA
  into play. There's speculation on the street he just wants to
  move onto somthing else,"" said one arbitrager. ""We think TWA
  might just be putting up a trial balloon.""
      Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir,
  but that the airline will probably reject it because the price
  is relatively low compared to other airline deals.
      They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by
  revealing financing arrangements. ""They need to show their
  commitment and their ability to finance. I think it's a
  credible offer,"" said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst.
      ""I think it's certainly on the low end of relative values
  of airline deals,"" said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would
  be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers.
      USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A
  spokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not
  changed its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of
  that airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance
  for 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock.
      USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln
  shares.
      Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also
  remained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding
  65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp.
      Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with
  its offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont
  and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover
  of Piedmont.
      Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to
  make his own airline a more attractive takeover target.
      ""Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there
  were no takers. I think the strategy might have called for
  making his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish
  that specific objective is to go out and acquire other
  airlines,"" said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming.
      ""I don't know whose going to buy them, but at least this
  way it becomes a much more viable package,"" said Kim.
      But Icahn's financing ability for such a transaction
  remains in doubt, in part because of TWA's heavy debt load.
      Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do
  the offer.
      The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial
  advisers and plans to make his own arrangements.
     Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp &lt;X>
  and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock.
      Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan was
  impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham
  Lambert Inc, because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal.
      Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA
  offer on price and financing concerns. ""It's littered with
  contingencies and it doesn't even have a financing
  arrangement,"" said one executive at another major airline.
      But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a
  strong contender with USAir's east coast route system and
  planned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the
  intenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in
  its St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast,
  to the mix would develop an even stronger force.
      The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservation
  system.
      Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would
  result in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.

  Allis-Chalmers Corp said it asked
  lenders and other groups to approve a restructuring plan that
  would cause a dilution of the company's existing common stock.
      The company said it would sell all of its businesses other
  than the American Air Filter business, make a public financing
  of more than 100 mln dlrs and pay part of the currently
  outstanding debt with the proceeds.
      Under the plan, which was presented to institutional
  lenders, the company's unions and the Pension Benefit Guaranty
  Corp, ""substantial amounts"" of institutional debt would be
  converted to common stock of the restructured company.
      Allis-Chalmers said it will exchange existing preferred
  stock for common. The exchange of the institutional debt and
  preferred stock for common equity will cause a ""resulting
  dilution of the existing common stock,"" Allis-Chalmers said in
  a statement.
      Under the plan, holders of existing common would hold about
  15 pct of the restructured common stock. Holders of existing
  preferred would hold about 35 pct of the new common.
      Allis-Chalmers said its only alternative to the plan is
  bankruptcy. The restructuring must be approved by creditors,
  common and preferred holders,and present and former employees.
      Allis-Chalmers said a bankruptcy filing ""appears to
  represent the company's only alternative if agreement upon the
  terms of the plan cannot be reached.""
      The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that he was
  not aware of any extraordinary charge against earnings that
  would result from the restructuring.
      ""It is too early to talk about a charge"" because the plan
  must still be approved by the lenders and unions, he said.
      Also under the plan, payments to Allis-Chalmers' private
  lenders would be deferred. Trade payables and obligations
  incurred in the ordinary course of business will be met.
      Payment of health benefits for active and retired employees
  would be made ""at substantially reduced levels.""
      Allis-Chalmers, once one of the leading farm equipment
  companies, sold all of its farm equipment operations to Deutz
  of West Germany for 107 mln dlrs, leaving the company with
  businesses in lift trucks, air conditioning, fluids handling
  and solid materials processing.
      Last year, Allis-Chalmers sold the lift truck business to
  AC Material Handling Co of Columbus, Ohio.
      Under the restructuring plan, Allis-Chalmers will sell its
  solid materials processing and fluids handling businesses.
  Solid materials processing, which makes equipment to crush
  stones for highway construction, accounted for 288 mln dlrs of
  Allis-Chalmers's total 1985 revenues of 886 mln dlrs.
      The company will also sell its fluids handling operations,
  which makes pumps and valves. That business accounted for 196
  mln dlrs of the company's 1985 revenues.
      Allis-Chalmers in 1986 reported a net loss of 8.6 mln dlrs,

1431,1,"HK BANK EXPECTED TO POST 10 TO 13 PCT PROFIT RISE
  The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp
  &lt;HKBH.HK> is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and
  13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth,
  share analysts polled by Reuters said.
      Their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last year
  ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will be
  announced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion.
      They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of
  42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a
  one-for-five bonus issue.
      Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus
  issue this year, probably one for three or one for five.
      The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd &lt;HSGH.HK>
  is to report its 1986 results on Friday.
      Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more
  than one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to
  12 pct.
      They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs
  for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985.
      Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner
  reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise,
  Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the
  Hong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by
  nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct.
      ""They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand,
  as their loan portfolio is well balanced,"" an analyst at Mansion
  House Securities (F.E.) Ltd said.
      Government figures show that total loans and advances rose
  by 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985.
      Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade, the mainstay of
  the local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five
  pct in 1985.
      Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received
  on loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986,
  but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and
  Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking
  system, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds.
      The strength of the real-estate market was another major
  income source for the bank group. Loans to finance property
  development and instalment mortgages rose sharply.
      ""The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage
  business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group
  and other foreign banks,"" one analyst said.
      The high level of activity on the capital and equities
  markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong
  Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd &lt;WAIA.HK> and &lt;James Capel and
  Co>, analysts said. ""Wardley had a tremendous year acting as
  financial adviser and underwriter,"" an analyst said.
      Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlr
  flotation of &lt;Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which Hongkong
  Bank owned 30 pct at the time.
      The bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return
  for 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake
  in &lt;South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of two
  English-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs.
      The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will
  not show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said.
      Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced
  need to write off bad debts. ""The need for provisions was much
  lower than the year before,"" said Tony Measor of Hong Leong
  Securities Co Ltd. ""Last year's profits should have been 2.8 to
  2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions.""
      Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the
  bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its
  shipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities
  Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She
  forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs.
      The bank's Latin American exposure, mainly through its
  51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, appears to have
  improved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland's 1986
  fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs
  from 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145
  mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985.

  divestiture plan devised by Hughes.  Hughes' board had
  previously found unacceptable a U.S. Justice Department consent
  decree that would have required broader divestitures.
      Baker said it has not obtained any satisfactory explanation
  from Hughes of its objections to the provisions of the Justice
  Department consent decree.
      Hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at which
  shareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting the
  counting of votes on the deal.  Baker said it believes the vote
  was overwhelmingly in favor of the merger.
      Baker said the new terms that Hughes proposed for the
  merger, as an alternative to the consent decree, were ""more
  burdensome"" than those of the consent decree themselves.
      Baker said divestitures under the consent decree would
  reduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrs
  or three pct.
      Baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures of
  the units named in the consent decree.
      It said its suit names as defendants Hughes and certain of
  its directors and seeks either an injunction forcing Hughes to
  live up to the merger agreement or ""substantial"" monetary
  damages it did not name.
      Baker said it believes the merger to be in the best
  interests of shareholders of both companies.

1439,2,"USAIR &lt;U> REJECTS TWA &lt;TWA> TAKEOVER BID
  USAir Group Inc said its board has
  rejected Trans World Airlines Inc's offer to acquire USAir for
  52 dlrs per share in cash as grossly in adequate and not in the
  best interests of USAir shareholders, employees or passengers.
      The company said the unsolicited bid by the Carl C.
  Icahn-led TWA was ""highly conditional.""
      USAir said its board and that of Piedmont Aviation Inc
  &lt;PIE> met separately yesterday to consider USAir's offer to
  acquire 50.1 pct of Piedmont for 71 dlrs per share and
  remaining shares for 1.5 to 1.9 common shares each, valued at
  about 73 dlrs per share based on the average closing price of
  USAir common during a period just before the merger.
      The company said it is continuing talks with Piedmont on
  arriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companies
  hope to reach one very shortly.
      USAir said ""In light of the highly conditional nature and
  other terms of the TWA offer, the timing of the offer and the
  circumstances under which it was made, USAir Group believes
  that the purpose of the TWA offer is to interfere with USAir
  Group's proposed acquisition of Piedmont.
      ""TWA's proposal is nothing more than an attempt by Carl
  Icahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour USAir Group's acquisition
  of Piedmont, a transaction which the USAir Group board views as
  most beneficial to USAir Group shareholders, employees and
  passengers and which Mr. Icahn obviously regards as contrary to
  his own personal interests.""
      USAir said its board has authorized counsel to explore all
  appropriate legal remedies against what it called TWA's
  last-minute attempt to interfere with USAir Group's acquisition
  of Piedmont.
      The company said conditions to the TWA offer include TWA
  obtaining financing, the USAir board redeeming defensive rights
  issued to shareholders last year and acting to render the ""fair
  price"" provision contained in USAir's charter inapplicable to
  the TWA offer and Transportation Department approval.

1440,1,"JAGUAR SEES STRONG GROWTH IN NEW MODEL SALES
  Jaguar Plc &lt;JAGR.L> is about to sell its
  new XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects a
  strong reception based on its success in the U.K., Chairman Sir
  John Egan told a news conference.
      Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to
  830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly
  below 1985's 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average
  profit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction of
  the new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down.
      Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to
  sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987.
      U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover,
  finance director John Edwards said.
      A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards
  said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German
  competitors offered an ""umbrella"" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6
  had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would
  restrict the car's price.
      Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a
  12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of
  its receipts for longer periods, John Egan said.
      In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10
  pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct
  of net sales and training two pct.
      Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the
  other half. The firm is in early stages of considering the
  building of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg,
  but Egan said this would take at least another three years
      On the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar's shares were last
  quoted at 591p, down from 611p at yesterday's close, after
  reporting 1986 results which were in line with market
  expectations, dealers said.

  Five consortia have applied to buy the

  give the owners control of 16 pct of the French telephone
  switching market, sources close to Finance Minister Edouard

      The French government has given itself until the end of

      While several foreign groups have said they want to gain a

  limited to 20 pct under privatisation laws passed last year,
  with 80 pct to be left in French hands.
      The Finance Ministry sources gave no details of the groups
  interested in CGCT, but several have publicly announced their
  candidacies.
      U.S. Telecommunications giant American Telephone and
  Telegraph Co &lt;T.N> which has been at the centre of the two-year
  battle for CGCT, has teamed up with the Dutch-based &lt;Philips

      A second bid has come from the West German electronics

  in CGCT, with the French telecommunications &lt;Jeumont-Schneider>
  taking the remaining 80 pct.
      Sweden's &lt;AB LM Ericsson> has also submitted a bid for the
  maximum 20 pct permitted, in association with French defence
  electronics group &lt;Matra>, which would hold between 40 and 49

1463,1,"ROYAL DUTCH/SHELL U.S. EARNINGS SHARPLY LOWER
  Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AS> earnings
  for 1986 from the U.S. Fell sharply because of difficult market
  conditions, lower crude and gas prices and also due to
  different accounting methods, Shell chairman Peter Holmes said.
      The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year,
  while the additional effect of currency movements reduced the
  contribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg.
      The group earlier reported a drop in net income for the
  year to 2.54 billion stg from 3.03 billion previously, with
  lower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by
  volume.
      Although the figures were lower, they were nonetheless at
  the top end of market forecasts. Shell Transport and Trading
  Plc &lt;SC.L> shares, the U.K. Arm of the group, rose to 11.39 stg
  from a close last night of 11.06 stg. Analysts noted that a
  general collapse in exploration and production volumes was
  partially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln
  stg from 205 mln in 1985.
      Also, a windfall tax credit and lower than expected
  currency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter
  results, which was the main reason for the figures exceeding
  forecasts, industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete
  Wedd noted.
      However, he added there could well be a sharp fall in
  performance in the first quarter of 1987, due to the
  improbability that the group would be able to repeat the high
  refining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986.
      The impact of recovering oil prices would come through
  faster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a
  high proportion of upstream activity centred on gas, which
  typically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year
  lag, analysts said.
      Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the third
  quarter of 1986 had been the worst of all.
      Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in
  the period, with Shell Oil being one of them. The decrease in
  U.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group
  had increased share to become volume market leader, Holmes
  added.
      Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue
  U.S. Exploration activity. ""Exploration is currently pretty
  flat. We are going to go on, but at 16-18 dlrs there will be no
  massive upturn,"" he said.
      A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North
  Sea and the U.S. Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel.
      Ultimately this would lead to a rise in U.S. Imports. ""If
  you are not exploring you are not going to find anything,"" he
  noted.
      U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day
  (bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed
  below 20 dlrs a barrel.
      This favored OPEC's attempts to stabilise prices, as the
  lower the price the more likelihood there was of non-OPEC
  marginal production shutting down. ""OPEC has done pretty
  extraordinarily well...Everything is moving in (its) direction,""
  he added.

  bought at a relatively bargain price today.
      Ryan said ""you always have to look at Polaroid at its

  weakness."" Polaroid's stock, which gained more than a point
  early this morning, was trading at 76-1/8, up 5/8. It was down
  over three points Wednesday morning before closing down 7/8.
      ""Polaroid is working overtime on production of cameras and

  pct,"" Ryan said, estimating earnings of 70 cts a share in the

1481,2,"SHAD SEES PROGRESS ON INSIDER TRADING
  Securities and Exchange Commission
  chairman John Shad said progress was being made in stopping
  insider trading, but the chairman of a House subcommittee with
  jurisdiction over securities laws said he was concerned about
  conditions on Wall Street.
      ""Greed has created a feeding frenzy on Wall Street and in
  the process laws are broken and multi-billion dlr corporations
  have become easy prey,"" Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass, the
  chairman of the Telecommunications and Finance said at the
  start of a hearing on SEC activities.
      ""Congress is understandably nervous. We perceive the
  current scandals as a warning of even worse things to come,""
  Markey said. ""The frenzy and disruption created by merger mania
  is particularly distressing.""
      Shad said the recent cases involving Ivan Boesky, Dennis
  Levine and others was a warning that those who engage in
  insider trading were taking a heavy risk of imprisonment, high
  fines and disbarment from the securities industry.
      ""Insider trading has not been eradicated, but it has been
  inhibited and multimillions of dollars of profits that Boesky
  and others have been siphoning off the markets are now flowing
  through to legitimate investors and traders,"" Shad said in his
  statement.
      Shad said insider trading cases involved only 10 pct or
  less of SEC enforcement actions in recent years but they have
  increased significantly to 125 cases brought during the past
  five years compared to 77 cases in the preceeding 47 years.
      Markey said he did not favor banning takeovers but thought
  the tender offer process needed reform including earlier
  disclosure of takeover attempts.
      N.J. Rep. Mathew Rinaldo, the senior subcommittee
  Republican, said he was introducing legislation to create a
  five member commission to study the securities industry for a
  year and report its findings and recommendations to Congress.
  Commission members would be appointed by the SEC.
      ""Its primary mission would be to analyze the extent of
  illegal trading on insider trading and to assess the adequacy
  of existing surveillance systems and government oversight
  operations. The commission would advise Congress as to what
  additional resources or civil or criminal remedies are needed
  to combat fraud and improve compliance with federal laws,""

  The U.S. Department of Transportation

      The department said the acquisition is not likely to
  substantially lessen competition and would not harm the public
  interest.
      The department had given its tentative approval of the
  acquisition in January.
      The department said it decided to make final its tentative
  decision after reviewing the public response to it.
      The agency said it rejected an assertion by Air North
  America, which currently is not operating but plans to start
  service to some of the cities served by USAIR and PSA, that the
  acquisition would lessen chances of new entry into those
  markets by other carriers.
      The agency said Air North America provided no support for
  its claim that the transaction would give the two carriers
  monopoly power in some markets.
      The transportation agency said Air North America also
  failed to show that there are barriers that would prevent new
  entrants into those markets or prevent other carriers from
  increasing their service.
      The agency noted in its final order that PSA operates
  exclusively in the West and Mexico while USAir serves the West
  for the most part with some long-haul flights from the East and
  Midwest.
      The two carriers serve five point in common; Los Angeles,
  San Diego, San Francico, Phoenix and Tucsonm, the agency said.
       The transportation department also rejected a request by
  the Teamsters Union, which represents some PSA workers, to
  require protections for PSA workers.
      The agency noted that USAir has promised to give protective
  benefits to PSA workers and that unions representing PSA
  workers have collective bargaining agreements that provide such

  Chrysler Corp said its board declared a
  three-for-two stock split in the form of a 50 pct stock
  dividend and raised the quarterly dividend by seven pct.
      The company said the dividend was raised to 37.5 cts a
  share from 35 cts on a pre-split basis, equal to a 25 ct
  dividend on a post-split basis.
      Chrysler said the stock dividend is payable April 13 to
  holders of record March 23 while the cash dividend is payable
  April 15 to holders of record March 23. It said cash will be
  paid in lieu of fractional shares.
      With the split, Chrysler said 13.2 mln shares remain to be
  purchased in its stock repurchase program that began in late
  1984. That program now has a target of 56.3 mln shares with the
  latest stock split.
      Chrysler said in a statement the actions ""reflect not only
  our outstanding performance over the past few years but also

1512,1,"CANADIAN IMPERIAL SEES LOWER LOAN LOSSES
  &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>,
  earlier reporting higher net income for the first quarter ended
  January 31, said it expects loan losses to be lower than last
  year's 697.0 mln dlrs.
      However, the bank said it will maintain the high level of
  provisioning for loan losses established last year because of
  many market uncertainties. Commerce bank set loan loss
  provisions of 636.0 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986, ended October 31.
      The bank earlier said first quarter net income rose to 96.5
  mln dlrs from 87.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Profit per basic
  share after dividends fell to 61 cts from year-ago 64 cts.
      Commerce Bank said because of market uncertainties, it used
  an estimate of 600.0 mln dlrs for fiscal 1987 loan losses in
  calculating first quarter results.
      The bank's first quarter provision for loan losses rose to
  172.0 mln dlrs, from 152.0 mln dlrs in the prior year.
      Commerce Bank also said it will continue to adopt an
  agressive posture in adding to its general provisions against
  loan exposure to 34 countries designated by the federal
  government's Inspector General of Banks.
      First quarter net partly benefitted from net interest
  income, up to 561.8 mln dlrs from year ago 540.9 mln dlrs.
      Commerce Bank said improved other income, which rose to
  213.6 mln dlrs from year-earlier 170.1 mln dlrs, and net income
  was partially offset by the increased loan loss provisions,
  non-interest expenses and income taxes.
      The bank said first quarter total assets increased to 83.92
  billion dlrs from 78.93 mln dlrs in the prior year, due mainly
  to continued expansion in consumer loan and mortgage fields.
      Return on assets increased by two cts to 46 cts per 100
  dlrs of average assets from the first quarter in fiscal 1986,
  but declined two cts from fiscal 1986 fourth quarter.
      The bank also said total non-accrual loans increased to 2.4
  billion dlrs in the first quarter from year-ago 1.8 billion
  dlrs. However, non-accrual loans declined 130 mln dlrs from
  fiscal 1986 year-end.
      ""Despite the recent announcement of the suspension of
  interest payments by Brazil, virtually all of the bank's loans
  to this country were income producing up to January 31, 1987,
  and there was little adverse impact on the bank's earnings
  prior to the announcement,"" Commerce bank said.
      The bank did not disclose a forecast of the impact on
  future earnings by Brazil's suspension of interest payments.

  Hughes Tool Co Chairman W.A. Kistler
  said its counter proposal to merge with Baker International
  Corp was still under consideration and that a merger was in the
  best interests of both companies.
      ""Our hope is that we can come to a mutual agreement that is
  good for both companies,"" Kistler said of the proposed merger
  that would result in a 1.2 billion dlr oil field service
  company. ""We're working very hard on this merger.""
      Hughes' board today again adjourned a shareholders meeting
  to vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for March 11
  to give Baker more time to consider the counter proposal.
      The Hughes board, which had previously expressed concern
  about a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that would
  require Baker to sell its drilling bit operations and
  submersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened to
  terminate the proposed merger.
      The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the two
  companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses
  before signing the decree.
      The directors of Baker immediately after receiving the
  counter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas state
  court to force to Hughes to complete the merger.
      ""The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might
  be imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervous
  about what the outcome might be,"" Kistler said, in explaining
  why Hughes had made the counter proposal.
      ""We need additional time to understand why Baker did not
  accept our proposal.""
      Kistler also said that the law suit filed by Baker ""was not
  a factor"" in the board's decision to keep its merger proposal
  on the table.
      He declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit.
      Kistler said Hughes would be willing to consider a
  compromise counter proposal, but declined to be more specific.
      The Justice Department in January said it would block the
  Hughes and Baker merger on anti-trust grounds unless both
  companies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide
  for the sale of the assets after the merger took place.
      The Hughes board said it would not sign the decree because
  its was too ""unreasonable."" Hughes said that Baker should
  instead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the
  merger is finalized and given government approval.
      Under the decree, if Baker is unable to find acceptable
  buyers within a specified period of time after the decree is
  approved, a federal trustee would become responsible for
  finding a buyer.
      Kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could take
  up to 10 years to complete the sales.
      He also expressed concern that the combined companies might
  be required by the government's conditions to license some of
  its technology to any purchaser of the assets.
      Baker said last night in a statement that the required
  assets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs,
  representing about three pct of the revenues of the combined
  companies.

  Generale &lt;STGN.PA>'s regional bank subsidiary &lt;Societe Generale
  Alsacienne de Banque>, SOGENAL, from next Monday, SOGENAL
  officials said.
      SOGENAL, founded in 1881 and nationalised in 1982, is the
  leading French regional bank and has branches in Austria,
  Belgium, Luxembourg, East and West Germany and Switzerland.
      Chairman Rene Geronimus told a news conference the share
  offer price, expected to be announced tomorrow by Finance
  Minister Edouard Balladur, would be between 110 and 130 francs.
      Societe Generale, which will itself be privatised later
  this year, will retain its 52.58 pct majority holding in the
  bank, Chairman Marc Vienot said.
      SOGENAL officials said they forecast 1987 consolidated
  group profit of around 170 mln francs after an estimated 160
  mln this year and 159 mln in 1985.
      SOGENAL's privatisation will be preceded by a capital
  increase to 320 mln francs from 263 mln, earning about 250 mln
  francs in new funds. Its shares will be divided by eight,
  giving a capital of 12.8 mln shares of 25 francs nominal.
      The bank will be listed on the Nancy stock exchange, in
  line with the Finance Ministry and government's aim of a
  regional operation, Geronimus said.
      He said he was hoping for shareholders to total around
  30,000 to 35,000 against the 12,500 before nationalisation. Ten
  pct of the capital to be floated will be reserved for employees
  with the rest offered to the public. There will not be a share
  reserved for foreign investors. ""This is too small an operation
  and anyway they will be able to buy shares in France,"" he said.
      Stockbroker sources said that a likely share offer price of
  120 francs would value SOGENAL at 1.5 billion francs.
      Geronimus said the bank's future aim would be to reinforce
  its existing strong points, with no major projects planned
  apart from the opening soon of a Basle branch.
      SOGENAL is the only French bank in Austria, it set up the
  first foreign exchange dealing room outside Paris at its
  Strasbourg headquarters in 1985, and is the only foreign
  banking subsidiary to be a broker on the Zurich Bourse.

      The drugs are PEG-superoxide disdmutase and PEG-catalase,

  Imperial Chemical Industries PLC
  expects earnings from its pharmaceuticals operations to grow

  compared with a current 30 pct, chairman elect Denys Henderson
  told financial analysts.
      ""Over the next five years we expect to launch one major new
  product each year,"" Henderson said.
      He also said research and development spending in this
  business segment will be increased to 14 pct of total sales
  income in 1987 from 13 pct, or 130 mln sterling, in 1986.
      ICI, the world's fifth largest chemicals firm in terms of
  sales, recently reported 1986 profits of about 888 mln dlrs on
  15 billion dlrs in sales, compared with income of 817 mln dlrs
  on 15.87 billion dlrs in sales a year earlier.
      Sales in the United States totaled about three billion
  dlrs, ICI executives said.
      In addition, Henderson said overall corporate growth will
  come from ICI's research and development activities, but the
  company intends to continue to grow through an acquisition
  program.
      ICI spent just under one billion dlrs for acquisitions
  during 1986, the largest of which was the 580 mln dlr purchase
  of Cleveland, Ohio-based Glidden Inc, a paints, resins and
  coatings company, from &lt;Hanson Trust PLC>.
      ICI financial director Alan Clements said the company's
  borrowing limits are at a level of about 6.3 billion sterling,

  Oppenheimer and Co analyst Robert
  McAdoo raised his 1987 earnings estimate for NWA Inc, parent of
  Northwest Airlines, following a strong quarterly report by the
  company yesterday, according to Oppenheimer market strategist
  Michael Metz.
      NWA shares rose 1-5/8 to 74-3/8 in active trading.
      McAdoo raised his 1987 estimate to 7.50 dlrs a share from
  five dlrs and maintained a buy recommendation on the stock,
  Metz said.
      McAdoo was traveling and could not be reached for comment.
      Yesterday, Minneapolis-based NWA reported fourth quarter
  net of about 9.8 mln dlrs or 45 cts a share against a loss of
  two mln dlrs or nine cts in the 1985 quarter.
      For the year, earnings rose to 76.9 mln dlrs or 3.26 dlrs
  from 73.1 mln or 3.18 dlrs. The 1986 results include Republic
  Airlines since NWA acquired it Aug 12, 1986.

  Yellow Freight System Inc said
  its expects 1987 first quarter profits to be substantially
  below the 14.2 mln dlrs or 50 cts a share earned in the same
  period a year ago.
      Revenues have been depressed by recent price discounting,
  added costs from expansion programs, lower shipping volumes and
  increased costs associated with severe weather conditions
  on the East coast, company officials told analysts here.
      An industry-wide rate hike of 2.9 pct, set for April one,
  will cover Yellow Freight's upcoming labor and other costs but
  will not make a contribution to operating margins, it said.

1586,2,"TALKING POINT/PIEDMONT &lt;PIE>
  Carl Icahn's bold takeover bid for
  USAir Group &lt;U> has clouded the fate of Piedmont Aviation Inc,
  which was being courted by USAir.
      Yesterday, Icahn's Transworld Airlines Inc &lt;TWA> made a 1.4
  billion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAir
  takeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to
  accepting the bid.
      Today, USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer and
  said the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its
  takeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment.
      Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was
  off 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread
  it would be taken over.
      Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt
  to either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a
  suitor who might want both airlines once they merged.
     ""The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or
  Piedmont and USAir announce a deal,"" speculated one arbitrager.
      Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current
  price of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid will
  succeed.
      Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk
  Southern Corp &lt;NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the
  company. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of
  Piedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.
      Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of
  Piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is
  destined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the
  least likely to be bought.
      Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in
  the airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a
  three-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.
      But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn's
  offer, which lacked financing and was riddled with
  contingencies.
      Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two
  airlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.
      ""You can't discount him,"" said one arbitrager.
      Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is
  serious by following through with his threats or making a new
  offer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go
  directly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower
  price if USAir rejected his offer.
      ""It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing,"" said
  one arbitrager.
      Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by
  about six dlrs per share.
      Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airline
  combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but
  others believe it could be cleared if the companies are
  acquired separately.
      ""TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to
  work,"" said one analyst.
      Analysts said such a merger would be costly and
  complicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn
  succeeded in winning concessions from its unions.
      In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wage
  scale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity,
  analysts said.
      Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they
  said. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines'
  costs when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a
  necessary ingredient for a merger to work.
      However, other analysts speculated the managements of
  Piedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new
  company. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way
  for him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then merged
  into TWA.

1587,2,"BAKER INT'L &lt;BKO> HOPES TO COMPLETE MERGER
  Baker International Corp treasurer Eric
  Mattson said the company hoped to iron out snags in a proposed
  merger with Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT> but declined to say if or what
  compromises might be acceptable to it.
      The proposed merger that would create a 1.2 billion dlr
  oilfield services company was thrown into limbo yesterday when
  Hughes management, balking at the terms of a government consent
  decree, offered a counter-proposal to Baker.
      Earlier today, Hughes adjourned a shareholders meeting
  called to vote on the proposed merger until March 11 and said
  it hoped to resume negotitations with Baker.
      Hughes chairman W.A. Kistler told reporters that Hughes did
  not want to sign the Department of Justice consent decree until
  after Baker's submersible pump and drilling bit operations were
  sold.
      Mattson told Reuters that Baker still believed a merger was
  possible between the two giant oilfield service companies.
      ""The company's position is we would like to see the merger
  be completed, which is in the best interests of our
  shareholders and their shareholders,"" Mattson said.
      ""Our goal is for a merger to occur. Because of the
  litigation, I can't go any further than that,"" he said.
      Baker filed a lawsuit in Texas state court late yesterday
  to force Hughes to abide by terms of the proposed consent
  decree.
      Mattson also declined to comment on whether the directors
  of Baker and Hughes have scheduled any meetings to discuss the
  merger.

  Union Carbide Corp said its 1986
  long term debt was 3.06 billion dlrs compared to 1.71 billion
  dlrs in 1985.
      The company released its audited 1986 results.
      The company also said its long term debt was reduced by
  about 1.5 billion dlrs from the third quarter to the end of the
  year by asset sales and equity offerings. Union Carbide sold
  its battery products, home and automobile products and
  agricultural products businesses in 1986. In the fourth
  quarter, it offered 30 mln shares of stock, raising about 650
  mln dlrs.
      The asset sales and equity offering were part of a
  recapitalization plan undertaken by the chemicals company last
  year.
      Audited net earnings in 1986 of 496 mln dlrs or 4.78 dlrs a
  share compared to a 1985 loss of 581 mln dlrs or 2.78 dlrs were
  unchanged from the company's preliminary earnings report made
  on Jan 28. The earnings results for the fourth quarter were
  also unchanged.
      Included in the 1986 numbers are a 564 mln dlr gain from
  sale of the different businesses, a 270 mln dlr pension credit
  and a charge of 473 mln dlrs from the purchase of long term
  debt at a premium under the recapitalization.
      In the audited results released today, the company broke
  down results by business segment.
      Operating profit in the fourth quarter for all of the
  company's operations on a consolidated basis, before corporate
  and interest expense and taxes, was 181 mln dlrs against a loss
  of three mln dlrs in the 1985 quarter.
      In the year, operating profit was 791 mln dlrs compared to
  a loss of 253 mln dlrs in 1985.
      In a statement, the company said it defeated a hostile
  takeover attempt, by GAF Corp &lt;GAF>, and recapitalized the
  company, adding, ""While all this was going on, our continuing
  businesses performed very soundly, with substantial operating
  profit improvement over 1985.""
      Carbon products posted operating profit of eight mln dlrs
  in the quarter, down from 29 mln dlrs, and 49 mln dlrs in the
  year against a loss of 146 mln dlrs.
      Chemicals and plastics had fourth quarter operating profit
  of 122 mln dlrs compared to a year-ago loss of 49 mln dlrs. In
  the year, chemicals and plastics earned 472 mln dlrs against
  losses of 142 mln dlrs in 1985.
      Operating income at industrial gases rose to 64 mln dlrs
  from 55 mln in the quarter and to 276 mln dlrs from 222 mln in
  the year.
      The company's specialties and services segment cut its
  losses in the quarter to 13 mln dlrs from 40 mln dlrs and in
  the year to three mln dlrs from 181 mln dlrs.
      Eliminations of business conducted between the company's
  industry segments contributed two mln dlrs to fourth quarter
  1985 profits but did not affect the 1986 quarter. The
  eliminations caused losses of three mln dlrs compared to six
  mln dlrs in the year.
      The 1985 operating results include a host of unusual
  writeoffs and depreciation charges totaling 134 mln dlrs in the
  quarter and 906 mln dlrs in the year.
      Capital expenditures rose to 524 mln dlrs in 1986 from 501
  mln dlrs.
      By segment, spending at carbon products fell to 42 mln dlrs
  from 57 mln dlrs and spending fell at specialties and services
  to 126 mln dlrs from 143 mln dlrs.
      At chemicals and plastics, expenditures rose to 147 mln

      The company's cash and equivalents fell to 299 mln dlrs at

  Humana Inc said its board
  approved a shareholder rights plan, or so-called poison pill
  plan, to ensure its shareholders receive fair treatment in the
  event of a proposed takeover.
      Humana said it is now aware of any effort to gain control
  of the company.
      Under the plan its board declared a dividend distribution
  of one right for each outstanding common share held as of March
  16. It said each right entitles holders to purchase a unit of
  1/100 of a share of newly authorizes series A participating
  preferred at 75 dlrs per unit.
      Humana said the rights become effective after an entity
  acquires 20 pct or more of its outstanding common or tenders
  for 30 pct of its stock. After such an acquisition, then each
  right entitles holders to purchase securities of the company or
  an acquiring entity having a market value of twice the right's
  exercise price.
      Humana said the rights expire March 4, 1997, unless
  redeemed earlier. It said the rights may be redeemed by the
  company for one ct per right at any time prior to 10 days
  following a public announcement that a 20 pct position has been
  acquired.

1620,2,"HUGHES &lt;HT> CHANGES STANCE ON MERGER AFTER SUIT
  A one billion dlr lawsuit pushed
  Hughes Tool Co into an about-face on its rejection of a
  proposed merger with Baker International Corp &lt;BKO>, Wall
  Street analysts said.
      Last night, Hughes said the planned merger with Baker was
  off. Baker then filed a suit seeking punitive damages from
  Hughes for calling off the merger. At midday today Hughes said
  it was still interested in the merger.
      The analysts also said Hughes may be worried that its
  troubles could make it a takeover candidate.
      There was speculation today that Harold Simmons, the Dallas
  investor, might try to acquire Hughes, but Simmons told Reuters
  he is not interested.
      Simmons said he intends to file a 13-D with the Securities
  and Exchange Monday reporting a stake of five pct or more in
  some publicly traded company. He declined to identify the
  target other than to rule out Hughes.
      One analyst said another factor in the latest Hughes
  turnabout was Borg-Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, which owns 18.5 pct of
  Hughes. Borg-Warner ex-chairman J.F. Bere, who serves on the
  Hughes board, is believed to favor the merger with Baker.
      Despite the Hughes statement that it is interested in a
  merger, and Baker's response that a merger is still possibile,
  analysts said no one could be certain where the situation was
  going.
      ""I think the merger is not going through,"" said Phil Pace,
  analyst at Kidder, Peabody and Co. He said the merger ""lost a
  lot of its appeal"" when the U.S. Department of Justice required
  that Baker sell off its Reed Tool Co operation.
      Although the Reed operation is relatively small in view of
  the total size of a combined Baker-Hughes, Pace said ""30 to 40
  pct of the cost savings are tied up in that.""
      ""They (Hughes) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit,""
  said James Crandell, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc.
  ""Apparently they are willing to continue discussions but
  whether they will alter their position, I don't know.
      ""It's getting a little confusing,"" said James Carroll,
  analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. He said the arguments cited
  by Hughes yesterday for not doing the merger ""tend to be weak.""
  Hughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it
  wanted Reed Tool and other businesses sold prior to April 22,
  the projected merger date. A government decree allowed a longer
  period of time.
      Hughes contended it was better to formally combine the
  companies with the status of Reed already settled. Baker
  apparently sees no reason to speed up the sale.
      Carroll said Baker had previously estimated 110 to 130 mln
  dlrs in savings if the companies were combined without selling
  Reed. But he said Baker now thinks 75 to 85 mln dlrs will be
  saved while Hughes sees a saving of only 50 to 60 mln dlrs.
      Carroll also noted that since the merger accord was first
  signed ""the outlook for the industry has improved materially.""
  Hughes may simply feel the pressure on the oil service industry
  is lifting.

  interests.
      The balance of REPH's common stock is owned by members of
  Republic management, McDonnell Douglas Corp &lt;MD>, Donaldson,
  Lufkin and Jenrette and Pacific Asset Holdings L.P.
      Republic currently owns 44 hospitals and manages 46 other
  facilities, in 25 states.
      Details of the proposal were not disclosed.  Company
  representatives were not immediately available.
      The proposal provides that REPH would become a wholly-owned
  subsidiary of Alpha and that the existing REPH common
  stockholders would become stockholders of Alpha, it said.
      REPH's board has appointed a special committee to negotiate
  terms of the proposed merger, Pesch said.
      Last year, Republic was acquired by REPH in a leveraged
  buyout transaction led by Dr. LeRoy Pesch, the principal
  shareholder of Pesch and Co.

  continuing concentration on advanced robotics, satellite-based
  communications and electro-optical defense systems will lead to
  significant growth in revenues and earnings over the next five

  drain on profits"" this year.
      It attributed its reduced 1986 earnings to communications

1634,2,"CHEMLAWN &lt;CHEM> REJECTS WASTE'S &lt;WMX> OFFER
  ChemLawn Corp said its board
  rejected Waste Management Inc's 27 dlr-per-share tender offer
  and urged its shareholders not to tender their shares.
      ChemLawn said its board asked management and its financial
  advisor, Smith Barney, Harris Upham And Co Inc, to seek other
  purchasers of the company to maximize shareholder value.
      ChemLawn also said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, or
  ""poison pill,"" during a 120-intermin safeguard period its board
  adopted to deter attempts to acquire the company through any
  means other than an all-cash tender offer while it seeks other
  purchasers.
      ChemLawn also said it began litigation against Waste
  Management in federal court in Columbus, seeking injunctive and
  other relief.
      The suit alleges, among other things, that certain Waste
  Management officers and directors purchased ChemLawn's stock
  before making the tender offer. ChemLawn claimed such purchases
  possibly violated the officers' fiduciary duties and the
  Securities and Exchange Commission's insider trading rules.
      Last week, Waste Management made a tender offer to acquire
  ChemLawn for 27 dlrs per share or 270 mln dlrs.
      ChemLawn said its board was determined that Waste's offer
  was inadequate and not in the best interest of shareholders,
  and could ""adversely affect"" the interests of its employees,
  suppliers, creditors, and customers.
      ""Our board carefully reviewed Waste Management offer and
  concluded that it does not fully reflect the value of the
  company. We strongly urge our shareholders not to tender their
  shares to Waste Management,"" said Chairman L. Jack Van Fossen.
      ChemLawn said its rights plan is designed to protect
  shareholders against abusive tactics, such as ""market
  accumulations by Waste Management or others.""
      Under the plan, one comon stock purchase right will be
  distributed as a dividend on each outstanding share of ChemLawn
  common.
      ChemLawn said its rights holders can buy a share of its
  common for one dlr if any entity acquires 25 pct or more of its
  commmon, other than by an all cash tender offer for all its
  shares or an approved acquisition agreement by its board.
      It said the rights expire July three 1987, or 60 days after
  they become exercisable if later than that date. It said its
  board may redeem the rights for five cts per right any time
  prior to their exercise date.
      ChemLawn said the plan will not be triggered by purchases
  purusant to Waste Management's present tender offer.
      It said the dividend will be paid to shareholders of record
  March 20.

  Paradyne Corp said it pleaded guilty

  Security Administration and agreed to pay 1.2 mln dlrs in fines
  and costs to the U.S. Government.
      The company also reached agreements in principle for an 8.1
  mln dlr settlement of class action law suits.
      About 2.9 mln dlrs of the class action settlement will be
  provided by Paradyne's insurance carrier. The settlement is
  contingent on court approval after notice to class members, it
  said.
       The criminal case settlement dismisses all charges
  including bribery and false statement, except for conspiracy to
  which Paradyne pleaded guilty.
      The criminal settlement includes the lifting of the
  government's suspension, the dismissal of the federal civil
  false claims suit and all charges against the individuals.
      Of the 2.9 mln dlrs the insurance carrier will provide for
  the civil settlement, 750,000 dlrs will go to settle a
  derivative lawsuit.
      For the year ended December 31, Paradyne reported a net
  loss of 38.5 mln dlrs. The year-end results include an 8.0 mln
  dlrs provision for future legal and or settlement costs to
  cover the civil and criminal settlements announced today.
      Paradyne also said it named Jerry Kendall as president and
  chief executive officer, succeeding Robert Wiggins who resigned
  as chairman and chief executive officer as part of the
  settlement of the indictment.
      Kendall formerly served as executive vice president and
  chief operating officer.
      The company also said that due to the sluggish marketplace,
  it does not expect to be profitable in the first quarter but is
  optimistic about the outlook for the year.
      For the first quarter of 1986, the company reported net
  income of 875,000 dlrs on sales of 66.0 mln dlrs.
      Wiggins was among five Paradyine executives who were
  charged along with three former officers in a 1985 federal
  indictment stemming from a 115 mln contract awarded to Paradyne
  in 1981 to build a computer network for the Social Security
  Administration.
      The men were accused of conspiring to bribe government
  officials and defaud the Social Security Administration.
  Wiggins and other defendants were also charged with providing
  false testimony and obstructing justice during a Securities and
  Exchange Commission investigation.
   
     Under the settlement announced today, federal prosecutors
  agreed to defer all charges against Wiggins and three other
  defendants under a one-year pretrial agreement.
      The charges would then be dropped if the defendants
  successfully complete the probation period. Details of the
  requirements in the agreement were not immediately available.

      Under federal law, it cannot buy more than 15 pct of

  Trans World Airlines Inc said it filed
  suit in Delaware Chancery Court against USAir Group Inc and its

  anti-takeover plan.
      TWA vice president and general counsel Mark Buckstein said
  TWA also sought a declaratory judgement from the court that its
  52 dlr per share takeover offer for USAir would in no way
  interfer with USAir's possible buyout of Peidmont Aviation Inc
  &lt;PIE>.
      Buckstein said TWA asked the court to enjoin the
  enforcement of USAir's shareholder rights plan, or ""poison
  pill."" Such provisions, which typically allow for the issue of
  securities to shareholders in the event of a hostile takeover
  bid, are aimed at deterring takeovers by making them more
  expensive.
      USAir earlier today rejected TWA's offer, saying TWA's bid
  was an attempt to interfer with its buyout of Piedmont.
      USAir also had said its counsel would investigate the
  matter. Tonight, a spokesman for USAir said the airline had no
  comment on TWA's lawsuit.
      USAir did respond, however, to a TWA request to the
  Department of Transportation for permission to buy up to 51 pct
  of USAir stock and place the stock in a voting trust pending
  approval of a takeover.
      USAir said the request was ""hastily pasted together in
  order to take advantage of a regulatory anamoly that would
  allow TWA to accomplish in a regulated environment actions that
  would be impermissable in the non-regulated economy at large.""
      USAir called on the transportation department to reject
  TWA's request.

      Reaffirming remarks made last year by chairman Howard
  Macdonald, Annesley said the company is considering selling its
  stake in Dome Mines.
      Concerning Dome Petroleum's 42 pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy
  Corp Ltd>, Annesley said ""Encor is a strategic investment for
  Dome, and we have no intention of selling it.""
      Dome spokesman Annesley said in answer to a question that
  he was not aware of any negotiations now under way toward the
  sale of Dome Petroleum's 20.9 mln Dome Mines shares.
      He also declined to specify at what price the company would
  consider selling it shares.
      ""Clearly today's prices of more than 15 dlrs a share (of
  Dome Mines stock) are very attractive,"" Annesley commented.
      ""We were considering the sale 'at the right price' at a time
  when the shares were priced around nine to 10 dlrs,"" he added. A
  price of around 15 dlrs a share would be considered ""fairly
  attractive,"" Annesley said.
      Annesley also Dome Petroleum may be able to sell its Dome
  Mines' shares at a premium to market prices. ""There might be an
  opportunity to pick up a premium on that because it would be
  virtually a control block in Dome Mines,"" he said.
      Dome Mines shares traded earlier at 15-1/4 dlrs, off 1/4 on
  the Toronto Stock Exchange.
      Dome Petroleum is now negotiating a plan to restructure
  debt of more than 6.1 billion Canadian dlrs with a group of 56

1692,2,"SANTA FE SOUTHERN &lt;SFX> APPEALS MERGER RULING
  Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp said it
  filed a petition asking the U.S. Interstate Commerce Commission
  to reconsider its earlier rejection of the merger of the
  holding company's railroad assets.
      The ICC had rejected in July the merger of the Santa Fe and
  Southern Pacific Railroads on the grounds that it would reduce
  competition.
      Santa Fe in its petition outlines an array of
  pro-competitive agreements with other railroads which would
  preserve the economic benefits of the merger for the merged
  railroad and the public.
      If the commission agrees that public benefits and
  competitive enhancements will result, it can vote to reopen the
  merger case. Interested parties have until March 25 to file
  statements in response to the supplemental petition.

1695,2,"NORDBANKEN TO AUCTION ITS FERMENTA SHARES
  Sweden's &lt;Nordbanken> banking group
  said it would sell the 4.2 mln B free shares deposited as loan
  collateral by Fermenta AB's &lt;FRMS.ST> founder and former chief
  executive Refaat el-Sayed and it planned to buy them up itself.
      The bank said the sale - by public auction on March 16 --
  was because of a debtor's inability to repay an overdue loan.
      The B free shares closed at 16.50 crowns on the bourse's
  unofficial list -- down from a peak of 300 in January 1986.
  Nordbanken said it did not exclude accepting a suitable bid for
  the shares although it expected to buy them back itself.
      The statement said the sale did not represent any
  withdrawal from Nordbanken's undertakings towards the Fermenta
  group and that it had been sanctioned by the other main
  shareholders.
      Nordbanken is Fermenta's third largest creditor with loans
  of 155 mln crowns. It was one of the four Swedish banks which
  last month agreed to advance the group 110 mln crowns to solve
  its immediate liquidity problems. Together with two other main
  shareholders, it also advanced Fermenta an additional 65 mln
  crowns until a new equity issue could be made.
      Fermenta is due to hold an extraordinary shareholders'
  meeting on Tuesday to approve the planned equity issue.
      Nordbanken had to make a provision against a 200 mln crown
  loan to el-Sayed in its 1986 results.
      Fermenta's new management originally hoped to raise 160 mln
  crowns through the new one for four rights issue and an extra
  170 mln from an issue to Nordbanken, another major creditor and
  shareholder &lt;Gotabanken> and the group's new majority owner
  &lt;Industrivarden AB>.
      The share price was to be 20 crowns. But there has been
  doubt over the plans since the stock fell below this level this
  week after Fermenta's former chairman Kjell Brandstrom said the
  company was in a much worse state than he thought.

1724,1,"ABN SAYS PROFIT RISE ENCOURAGING IN VIEW DOLLAR
  Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. &lt;ABNN.AS>
  chairman Robertus Hazelhoff said the bank's 10.3 pct increase
  in net 1986 profit to 527 mln guilders from 478 mln in 1985 was
  encouraging in view of the sharply lower dollar.
      Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the release
  of ABN's 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreign
  earnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance,
  notably in the securities business.
      He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10
  share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank's stock.
      News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN's share
  price on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders.
      Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely the
  future trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates and
  ABN's share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said.
      Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986
  by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1
  pct to 242 mln guilders, he added.
      Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earnings
  margins via traditional lending activities, he said.
      Hazelhoff said ABN was unlikely to continue reducing risk
  provisions in the future but he noted the bank was not overly
  concerned about default by Latin American debtors, a factor
  which brokers say has distanced Dutch insititutions from bank
  stocks recently.
      He said that of the bank's estimated 25 financially
  troubled sovereign debtors, about one quarter were Latin
  American countries. These would ultimately pay up, he said.
      He added that losses incurred through loans to tin
  producers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 had
  been written off.

  Communications to delay payment of 25 mln dlrs for 11 months.
      Telecom's shareholders are scheduled to vote on the 165 mln
  dlr transaction Monday.
      Telecom said it advised Siemens it intends to close the
  transaction on March 16, as scheduled, if it is approved by
  shareholders. A spokesman said this means Telecom will decide
  before the 16th whether or not to accept the proposed change.
      Explaining its request for the amendment, Siemens informed
  Telecom it had recently become aware of information causing
  concern with respect to certain accounting and other matters.
      Siemens said it will therefore need to continue its review
  beyond March 16 to determine whether certain representations
  and warranties are true.
      Telecom said it advised Siemens it knows of no information
  which would make its representations and warranties untrue.
      Siemens already owns the remaining 35 pct of Tel Plus. The
  65 pct represenmts Telecom's principal operating asset.
      A Telecom spokesman said the agreement calls for payment of
  all but 29 mln dlrs of the price at closing. Of this, 21 mln
  dlrs was to be paid 11 months later and two mln dlrs per year
  on the anniversary date of the transaction.
      He said Siemens is now proposing that 25 mln dlrs be added
  to the 21 mln dlrs to be paid in 11 months.
      Telecom said the proposed amendment would also permit
  Siemens to defer repayment of up to an additional 50 pct of

1746,2,"LUCKY STORES &lt;LKS>, EDELMAN IN STANDSTILL PACT
  Lucky Stores Inc said it and
  investor Asher Edelman agreed on a settlement that prohibits
  Edelman and his group from taking specified actions to obtain
  control of the company and that limits the Edelman group's
  ownership of Lucky's stock to less than five pct of any voting
  securities.
      The arrangement also provides for the dismissal of pending
  litigation between the parties, Lucky Stores said.
      The settlement also calls for the withdrawal of Edelman's
  motion to intervene in pending shareholder actions against
  Lucky Stores and its directors, the company said.
      In addition, the standstill provisions also apply to
  Hancock Fabrics after it is spun off to Lucky stockholders, the
  company said.
      Lucky Stores said the arrangement also calls for the
  company to submit to stockholders at a special meeting set for
  December 31 a proposal from Edelman seeking their views
  concerning repeal of a charter provision that limits the voting
  power of substantial Lucky stockholders.
      Edelman, who owns about five pct of Lucky Stores' stock,
  last year was rebuffed in his effort to acquire the company.
      Last October Lucky Stores implimented a restructuring
  program that included the repurchase of 28 pct of its own
  common shares and reincorporation in Delaware.
      The spinoff of Hancock Textile Co, a chain of 324 retail
  stores, was one of the key parts of the restructuring program.
      Edelman and his Plaza Securities Co partnership
  subsequently sued in an attempt to block the proposed
  reincorporation, which was a condition of the repurchase and
  restructuring plan.
      Under this latest arrangement, Lucky Stores said it agreed
  to reimburse the Edelman group for 2.8 mln dlrs of
  out-of-pocket expenses, which include litigation and other
  costs.
      ""This agreement serves the interests of Lucky stockholders
  by avoiding the significant cost of continued litigation and
  the accompanying demands on management time,"" Lucky Stores
  chairman John Lillie said in a statement.
  

"
1747,1,"ATT &lt;T> PHONE PROPOSAL TO HELP PROFITS
  American Telephone and Telegraph Co's
  proposal to deregulate its long distance phone service is
  unlikely to produce a radical change in phone rates, but it
  should help the company's profits, analysts said.
      ""Deregulation will mean more pricing discounts for large
  volume users, but status quo for residential users,"" said
  PaineWebber Group analyst Jack Grubman.
      But the proposals will scrap the pricing formula that has
  constrained the company's profits in the long distance
  business, leading to higher profit margins, analysts said.
      ATT has long pushed for deregulation of its long-distance
  business, the profits of which have been limited by a regulated
  rate-of-return on the company's investments. The rate was cut
  last year to 12.20 from 12.75 pct.
      Earlier today the company proposed to the Federal
  Communications Commission to scrap the formula, cut the amount
  of time needed to approve rate proposals, and leave it up to
  its competitors to oppose it filings.
      MCI Communications Corp &lt;MCIC> made a similar filing
  yesterday, saying greater the moves would increase competition
  in the telephone business.
      Analysts said the proposals will allow ATT to cut costs in
  the long-distance unit, and increase its profit margins
  previously constrained by the rate of return. But many said
  they did not expect the proposals to lead to higher prices in
  the industry, simply because of the competition the phone
  industry giant faces.
      ""You probably wouldn't see as much of a price decline,""
  said Gartner Group analyst Fritz Ringling. ""But you wouldn't
  see a rise."" Grubman said the proposals will allow ATT to
  selectively raise or lower prices, depending on the market. ""It
  will give ATT a lot more flexibility,"" he said.
      ATT now faces a period of comment in which a number of
  companies will be able to respond to the proposals in FCC
  hearings.
      It may face at least one strong opponent, U.S. Sprint, the
  long distance joint venture between GTE Corp &lt;GTE> and United
  Telecommunications Inc &lt;UT>.
      ""We think the Congress of the FCC should establish a
  reasonable rate of return. Someone should establish it,"" a U.S.
  Sprint spokesman said. But he added the company was not opposed
  to greater competition.
      It may also take some time for the proposals to go through,
  and in the process they may be altered by the various
  constituencies affected by the move.
      ""There's so much complexity, so much inertia, so much
  bureacracy, that stricly speaking about the mechanisms, it
  won't happen that fast,"" said analyst Victor Krueger of the
  Gartner Group.

  company's outstanding stock.
      The group already controls 1,647,481 Fairchild Industries

      The group said it filed on Wednesday with federal antitrust
  regulators for advance clearance to buy enough additional
  shares to increase its total stake to up to 49.9 pct of the
  total outstanding stock.
      The group said its representatives had met with Fairchild
  Industries officials to inform them ""that they do not believe
  management has been successful in enhancing or protecting
  shareholder values.""
      It said it was considering the additional share purchases
  to enable it to ""assert a greater degree of influence over the
  future management and policies of the issuer.""
      It said a decision on the specific level of share ownership
  it would seek depended on market prices, future changes in
  management policies, available financial resources and other
  factors.
      The group said it also reserved the right to pursue other
  measures intended to influence Fairchild management and
  policies, either alone or in concert with other investors.
      The group includes Soros and Quantum Fund, an offshore
  investment firm headquartered in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles
  that is advised by Soros.
      The group said that since its last SEC filing, made Jan. 2,
  it had purchased no additional Fairchild shares and had sold

  57 mln dlrs cash.
      Carling said it will record an extraordinary gain of about
  two mln dlrs after tax, or nine cts a common share resulting
  from the sale.
      The company did not elaborate further on financial terms.
      A Carling official later said in reply to an inquiry that
  Carling would record the extraordinary gain in its fourth
  quarter ending March 31.
      The move came after Carling's 50 pct-owner &lt;Rothmans Inc>

1768,2,"DOME PETE&lt;DMP> SAID TO BE PRESSED TO SELL ENCOR
  Dome Petroleum Ltd is under pressure
  from one of its largest creditors, &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of
  Commerce>, to sell its 42 pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy Corp Ltd>,
  energy industry analysts said.
      Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for
  part of its debt to Commerce Bank, estimated last year at 947
  mln Canadian dlrs, and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock to
  pay down debt, analysts said.
      ""The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in the
  direction that might make it a saleable asset,"" said one analyst
  who asked not to be named.
      Dome earlier said it was not considering selling Encor
  Energy, but reaffirmed the company's 23.3 pct interest in
  Canadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd &lt;DM> is up for sale ""at
  the right price.""
      Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10
  billion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment that
  it does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said. The
  Encor shares do not pay dividends.
      A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when asked
  whether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake.
      At current market prices, Dome's stake in Encor would be
  valued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Mines
  shares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs.
      Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may also
  prompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in the
  Canadian oil and gas producer, analysts said.
      ""Encor's stock price has improved quite substantially in
  recent weeks with a runup in crude prices,"" Peters and Co Ltd
  oil analyst Wilf Gobert commented.
      ""The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see it
  sold at these levels because they can get more for it now than
  they have been able to in recent years,"" he added.
      Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at
  7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around six
  dlrs in early February.
      The company also recently set up its own operating
  management, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum,
  Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented.
      Dome and Encor ""are actually going to get farther apart. So
  (the sale) does make a lot of sense,"" Mote said.
      However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest
  Encor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale
  proceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt to
  Commerce Bank.
      ""I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as
  they can,"" said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber.
      Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move to
  block such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets.
      ""Other creditors generally all want to make sure that
  something they might be able to get a piece of is not being
  sold out from under them,"" said analyst Gobert.
      Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr joint
  liability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic
  Petroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration.
      Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the
  possible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines.
      Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum's
  debt and has a ""right of consent"" to the sale of Dome Petroleum's
  holding.
      Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares
  would seek some type of relief on the company's debt
  obligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said.
      Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what
  price the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares,
  but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share ""are very
  attractive.""

  The U.S. Department of Transportation

  Trans World Airlines Inc for DOT approval for it to take
  control of USAir Group.
      The DOT added, however, that TWA was free to refile when it
  could put together an application for control that met the
  agency's procedural requirements.
      The DOT acted shortly after the U.S. Department of Justice
  disclosed that it supported dismissal of the TWA application.
      It was not immediately clear what impact the denial would
  have on TWA's bid to take over USAir.
      In its control application, TWA had acknowledged that
  additional documentation was required to meet DOT rules and
  said it would file more material on the morning of March 9.
      But the DOT said it would not wait.
      ""We have determined to dismiss TWA's application for
  approval of the acquisition of USAir,"" it said in an order
  issued late Friday.
      ""TWA's application clearly fails to comply with the filing
  requirements of our regulations...and TWA has provided no
  reason why we should accept such a deficient filing,"" it added.
      ""Accordingly, we will dismiss the application. TWA, of
  course, may refile it when it is able to comply with our
  procedural rules,"" the DOT said.
      The agency added that it would continue to consider a
  separate TWA request for federal clearance to purchase USAir
  stock through a voting trust.
      USAir had said earlier today that it asked the DOT to
  dismiss the TWA control application, on grounds the TWA filing
  did not meet DOT requirements.

  (UAB), the sixth largest commercial bank in the country, to
  rebuild public confidence in it.
      UAB called for a rights issue last November to raise 152.49
  mln ringgit to rectify its capital deficiency following an
  accumulated loss of 107.61 mln ringgit at end-1985, the central
  bank, Bank Negara, said in a statement.
      But only 16.99 mln ringgit in shares was taken up by
  shareholders, mainly local Indian and Malay businessmen and the
  Indian Government.
      Bank Negara said it subsequently took up the unsubscribed
  shares, totalling 135.5 mln of UAB's new paid-up capital of
  228.74 mln ringgit.
      It said the shares, held in trust, will be eventually sold.
      The central bank early this week also announced that it had
  bought 49.4 pct stake in another troubled commercial bank,
  &lt;Perwira Habib Bank Malaysia Bhd>, after the latter raised its
  capital to 405 mln ringgit from 105 in mid-January this year.
      Bank Negara said it does not intend to hold on to the

      ""The injection of capital in PHB and in UAB including the
  recamp of management in these banks are some of the measures
  taken by the bank to strengthen public confidence in the

1824,2,"PIEDMONT &lt;PIE> AGREES TO USAIR &lt;U> BUYOUT
  USAir Group Inc said Piedmont Aviation
  Inc has agreed to be acquired for 69 dlrs per share.
      The company, in a newspaper advertisement, said it has
  started a tender offer for all Piedmont shares at that price,
  and the Piedmont board, with two directors absent, has
  unanimously approved the bid.  The offer and withdrawal rights
  are to expire April Three unless extended, and the bid is to be
  followed by a merger at the same price.
      USAir said Piedmont has granted it an irrevocable option to
  buy up to 3,491,030 new shares under certain circumstances.
  Piedmont now has about 18.6 mln shares outstanding.
      USAir said the tender is conditioned on receipt of enough
  shares to give USAir at least a 50.1 pct interest in Piedmont
  on a fully diluted basis and approval by the U.S. Department of
  Transportation of a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to
  buy and hold shares pending review of its application to gain
  control of Piedmont.
      The company said its merger agreement with Piedmont
  provides that the offer is not to be amended without Piedmont's
  prior written consent in any way that would be adverse to
  Piedmont shareholders, but it said it could cut the number of
  shares to be bought without Piedmont's consent.
      USAir said it could reduce the number of Piedmont shares to
  be purchased in the offer to no less than the minimum number
  needed to cause the voting trust condition of the bid to be
  satisfied.
      In that case, it said if more than that minimum number of
  shares were tendered, it would buy shares on a pro rata basis.
      In February USAir had offered to pay 71 dlrs per share in
  cash for 50 pct of Piedmont's stock and 1.55 to 1.90 USAir
  shares for each remaining Piedmont share.
      Last week, Carl C. Icahn-controlled Trans World Airlines
  Inc &lt;TWA> made a conditional offer to acquire USAir for 52 dlrs
  per share, a bid that was rejected by the USAir board.
      The Transportation Department on Friday rejected TWA's
  application to acquire USAir on the grounds that the
  application failed to comply with department regulations by
  omitting necessary information.  TWA said it would refile
  today, providing the information needed.
      On Friday TWA said it had already acquired four mln shares
  or 15 pct of USAir.

1825,2,"WALLENBERGS FIGHT BID FOR SWEDISH MATCH STAKE
  Sweden's Wallenberg group fought back
  a bid by the London-based Swedish financier Erik Penser to
  secure a large stake in Swedish Match &lt;SMBS ST>, one of the
  companies at the core of their business empire.
      A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB
  Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken
  over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33
  pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match.
      Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier &lt;NOBL ST>, in which
  Penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market
  price for the Swedish Match option, the statement said.
      Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at
  424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting
  rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for
  the free shares.
      The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to
  49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital
  while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights
  and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match.
      The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previously
  amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company.
      The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400
  mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the most
  expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years
  to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators.
      The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an arms
  and chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo
  &lt;VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco
  &lt;ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs &lt;SKPS ST>.
      Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest
  shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB &lt;SKBS ST> and
  Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them.
      Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, also
  managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg
  company, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB &lt;ALFS ST>.
      During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on
  building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent
  any raid on the heart of their business empire.
      But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in the
  electrical engineering firm ASEA AB &lt;ASEA ST> is also too small
  at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing
  speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe
  interests to protect its core activities.

1826,2,"SOSNOFF STARTS BID FOR CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW>
  &lt;MTS Acquisition Corp>, a company
  formed by Martin T. Sosnoff, said it has started a tender offer
  for all shares of Caesars World Inc at 28 dlrs each.
      In a newspaper advertisement, MTS said the offer and
  withdrawal rights expire April Three unless extended.
      Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns about four mln
  of Caesars' 30.3 mln shares outstanding, or about 13.3 pct, and
  is Caesars' largest shareholder.  Caesars owns casino hotels in
  Nevada and honeymoon resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono
  Mountains.  It also controls Caesars New Jersey Inc &lt;CJN>,
  which owns an Atlantic City, N.J., casino hotel.
      For the second quarter ended January 31, Caesars World
  earned 12.6 mln dlrs on revenues of 190.4 mln dlrs, up from
  earnings of 7,500,000 dlrs and revenues of 163.8 mln dlrs a
  year before.  For all of fiscal 1986, the company earned 41.0
  mln dlrs on revenues of 694.4 mln dlrs.
      MTS said the offer is conditioned on receipt of at least
  enough shares to give Sosnoff a majority interest on a fully
  diluted basis, the arrangement of sufficient financing to buy
  all Caesars shares not already owned and pay related costs and
  approval by the New Jersey Casino control Commission and the
  NEvada Gaming Commission and State Gaming Control Board.
      MTS said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM> has committed to
  lend it 100 mln dlrs for the acquisition and use its best
  efforts to syndicate another 400 mln dlrs in senior financing
  for the transaction.
      It said its financial adviser, PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ>,
  has stated in writing that subject to market conditions, it is
  highly confident that it can arrange commitments for up to 475
  mln dlrs in ""mezzanine"" financing.
      MTS said it does not expect problems in obtaining New
  Jersey and Nevada regulatory approval for the acquisition,
  since ownership in a Caesars stake has already been cleared.
      In June 1986, Sosnoff requested a seat on the Caesars World
  board, a request that has not yet been granted.  In September
  1986, Sosnoff, who is chairman of &lt;Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital
  Corp>, filed for clearance under U.S. antitrust laws to raise
  his interest in Caesars World to 25 pct.
      Sosnoff said, in a letter to Caesars World chairman and
  chief executive officer Henry Gluck, that ""The decision to go
  directly to the shareholders was made at the urging of may
  financial and legal advisors, who repeatedly stressed to me the
  lack of responsiveness of the management in the past.""
      Sosnoff, who said he has made numerous efforts to express
  his views to management on ways of maximizing shareholder
  values, said Caesars twicce refused his request for a board
  seat.  ""My advisers felt that, had I given you advance notice,
  you would have used the time to throw up obstacles to my offer
  rather than giving it serious consideration,"" he said.
      Sosnoff said he hopes that Caesars World management will be
  willing to negotiate an acquisition agreement with him.
      ""As I have indicated publicly in the past, I believe
  operating management of the company has performed well and that
  appropriate consideration should be given to a significant
  equity interest for them in the company following the
  acquisition,"" Sosnoff said in the letter to Gluck.
      MTS said Sosnoff has asked the company to fix March 27 as
  the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled
  to authorize action without a meeting -- including the election
  or removal of directors.

  &lt;RENA.PA> said it and Chrysler Corp &lt;C> have signed a letter of
  intent in which Chrysler plans to buy American Motors Corp
  &lt;AMO.N>, 46 pct owned by Renault.
      Renault President Raymond Levy said in a statement issued
  by the French state car group the agreement was an important
  stage in Renault's redeployment. ""It will allow Renault to
  continue its export programme to the U.S. And also opens a
  perspective of cooperation with a major American constructor,""
  the statement said. Under the terms of the letter of intent,
  Chrysler will purchase Renault's stake held in the form of
  bonds and shares.
      The Renault statement quoted Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca
  as saying, ""We welcome AMC shareholders into the Chrysler
  family.""
      He added that the accord would allow Renault and Chrysler
  to study the development of future products destined to be
  distributed by Renault and Chrysler in the North American and
  world markets.
      ""Renault is a leader in our industry and I am happy to be
  working with them,"" Iacocca was quoted as saying.
      Chrysler will pay for Renault's AMC interests held in bonds
  by a 200 mln dlr bond and will pay up to 350 mln dlrs for
  Renault share interests, depending on AMC sales and future
  profits, the Renault statement said.
      The statement said the agreement in principle gave each
  side 30 days to put together a definitive accord. Approval
  would also be necessary from the Renault, Chrysler and AMC
  boards, from AMC shareholders and the relevant government
  authorities.
      If the deal goes ahead, the statement said, AMC
  shareholders other than Renault will receive Chrysler shares
  for each of their shares valued at four dlrs.
      AMC shareholders with convertible preferential shares will
  have the possibility to exchange them for Chrysler shares on
  the same conditions as those they would have had in exchanging
  them for AMC shares.

1839,1,"SOUTHERN &lt;SO> TO TAKE CHARGE ON VOGTLE COST
  Southern Co said it will take an
  after-tax charge of 226 mln dlrs against earnings no later than
  January 1988 because the projected cost of the Vogtle nuclear
  power plant has risen abover the amount which retail customers
  in Georgia will be asked to pay.
      The company's largest subsidiary, Georgia Power Co, said
  the budget for the plant has increased by 6.3 pct, or 522 mln
  dlrs, to 8.87 billion. However, because of a pledge the made
  last year to Georgia's Public Service Commission, the increased
  cost will not be included in the utility's retail electric
  rates.
      Geogia Power also said its board has delayed the scheduled
  completion of Vogtle's Unit Two to June 1989 from September
  1988. Unit Two is about 60 pct complete, it added.
      The utility said fuel loading has been completed at Unit
  One and the unit is being put through a series of low-power
  tests before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is asked for a
  full-power license.
      The nuclear power plant, located near Waynesboro, Ga., is
  co-owned by &lt;Oglethorpe Power Corp>, the Municipal Electric
  Authority of Georgia and the city of Dalton.
      Georgia Power said the revised Vogtle budget estimate was
  due to several factors, including additional labor costs
  incurred to keep the plant's first unit on schedule for
  commercial operation by June. The new figure represents the
  first change in the plant's budget since August 1985, when it
  was estimated at 8.35 billion dlrs.
      In March 1986, the utility told Georgia regulators it would
  ""cap"" the price of Vogtle its customers would be asked to pay
  at 3.56 billion dlrs, the company's share of the then projected
  8.35 billion dlr total. Under the new budget, Georgia Power
  said, its share amounts to 3.87 billion dlrs.
      Noting that Georgia Power's share of the Vogtle increase is
  313 mln dlrs, Southern said this will result in a charge
  against earnings of 177 mln dlrs after taxes.
      In addition, the company said, Georgia Power's contracts
  with the joint owners require the utility to buy back
  significant amounts of Vogtle capacity during the plant's
  initial years of operation. Under terms of the cap on costs, it
  will not attempt to recover the portion of the budget increase
  that applies to the buybacks.
      This bings the total amount that must be charged against
  earnings to 2326 mln dlrs after taxes, Southern said.
      Southern said new rules of the Financial Accounting
  Standards Board, which are effective in January 1988, require
  any costs that are determined nonrecoverable to be charged
  against earnings once that determination is made.
      The company also said its board has approved a capital
  budget of 2.1 billion dlrs in 1987, including work on the
  Vogtle project.
      It said a 5.9 billion dlr capita budget for the three-year
  period 1987-1989 was also outlined at the board meeting, noting
  this is 700 mln dlrs below the comparable figure for the years
  1986-1988.

  Continental Bank of Canada, a subsidiary

  common shareholders.
      The initial distribution will be in cumulative redeemable
  retractable floating rate class A preferred shares series II,
  which will carry a retraction right enabling holders to receive
  12.75 dlrs for each share.
      Continental said the 58.6 mln dlrs of existing outstanding
  preferred shares will be paid off at par plus accrued dividends.
       Continental said the notes will carry a dividend rate of
  72 pct of prime and it expects that the shares will trade at
  12.75 dlrs or more, enabling shareholders who wish to receive
  cash to do so.
      The bank said it expects the distribution will be made in
  early May, subject to various approvals.
      Continental also said that, as of March 2, it had cash of
  more than 250 mln dlrs and equity of about 284.6 mln dlrs,
  allowing for a final total distribution of 16.60 dlrs per
  common share.
      Continental Bank said it continues to expect that the final
  distribution to shareholders will be in the range of 16.50 dlrs
  to 17.25 dlrs per share and will take place in late 1988 or
  early 1989.
      Until the initial stock distribution takes place, regular
  dividend payments will be maintained on the existing preferred
  shares, the bank said.
      The distribution is part of the terms of Continental Bank
  of Canada's sale of its banking assets to Lloyds Bank Canada, a
  subsidiary of Lloyds Bank PLC.
      Continental Bank said Lloyds Bank Canada paid the balance
  of the purchase price but that it was lower than originally

      The company said under the agreement in principle, RKO's

      Late in 1985, Gencorp cut a deal with Fidelity, a Los

      The rating agency cited USAir Group's proposed acquisition
  of Piedmont Aviation Inc &lt;PIE>, as well as Trans World Airlines
  Inc's &lt;TWA> proposed cash merger with USAir.
      However, the status of TWA's bid for USAir Group is

  Group's Baa-1 senior debt and Baa-2 subordinated debentures,
  along with the USAir unit's A-3 senior debt and Baa-1
  subordinated debentures.
      Moody's said it would examine the effects of the proposed

  potential damage to the company's financial flexibility because
  of the probability of increased debt-service requirements.

  its common shares from real estate developer Donald Trump.

  the 3.06 mln shares held by Trump at 24 dlrs a share, or 62.4
  mln dlrs, while Trump agreed not to try to seek control of
  Bally.

  mln dlrs for certain agreements, claims and expenses related to
  his purchase of the Bally common stock, Bally said.
      Trump agreed not to buy any more Bally stock or to try to

  against an 11.4 pct fall estimated last November.

      ""I think the offer is too low by at least five points,""

  ""one of the finest casinos in the world.""
      Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns 13.3 pct of

      Following news of the tender offer Caesars World's shares

      A Caesars World spokesman said the company was declining

  last year reached 170 billion dlrs.
      In remarks prepared for a speech before the Economic Club
  of Detroit, Roderick said, ""There should be total resolve that
  the dollar versus other major currencies, as well as the
  currencies of other nations having a substantial trade surplus
  with us, must continue to decline so that the correction in our
  trade deficit starts on the road to recovery.""
      Roderick said the U.S. should be understanding of the
  ""economic pain"" our trading partners experience as a result of
  a falling dollar.
      But, he added, ""As painful as the correction may be to our
  trading partners, it is less painful than leaving the problem
  uncorrected because that would lead us into an inevitable,
  lengthy and steep world recession.""
      Roderick said between February 1985 and December 1986 the
  dollar fell by more than 40 pct in real terms against major
  industrial currencies and by 30 to 35 pct against a broader
  group of currencies of nearly all developing nations.
      At the end of 1986, he said, the value of foreign assets in
  the U.S. exceeded the value of U.S. assets abroad by 240
  billion dlrs, compared to five years ago when the U.S. had a
  surplus in assets of 141 billion. A company spokesman said the
  data were provided by economic consultants to USX.
      The primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pct
  rise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985, although other
  factors were involved, Roderick said. But it is wrong, he said,
  ""to attribute the massive trade deficit to a fundmental
  deterioration of U.S. productivity or of American product
  quality.""
      These areas need to be improved but they are not the root
  cause of the trade gap problem, Roderick said. He urged
  American manufacturers to become more competitive so they can
  compete in global markets.
      In the speech, the USX chairman also called for changes in
  securities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporate
  raiders and speculators.
      Among his proposals, which he presented to the Senate
  Banking Committee in testimony last week, were a requirement
  that raiders give 24-hour notice for every one pct of stock
  they acquire in a company.
      Roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for all
  cash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders be
  required to have financing in place before a tender is made.
      Further, raiders should be required to make an all-cash
  tender offer once they acquire 10 pct of a target company's
  stock, he said. And payment of greenmail, or a preferential
  price by a target company to buy back a raider's stake, should
  be prohibited under the revised laws.
      Roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses but
  that he did not want laws that would hurt the financial markets
  or discourage ""fair price to all"" takeovers.

  Canadian Pacific Ltd said fourth
  quarter 1986 operating profit rose to 91.6 mln dlrs, or 30 cts
  a share, from 50.7 mln dlrs, or 20 cts a share, a year ago.
      The statement confirmed released preliminary earnings
  figures the company released in February.
      A 102.6 mln dlr gain on the sale of CP's Cominco Ltd
  interest helped raise final 1986 fourth quarter profit to 193.8

      The company said a drop in 1986 full-year operating profit
  to 150.1 mln dlrs from a restated 252.7 mln dlrs in 1985 was
  due mainly to lower world oil prices.
      The company said its CP Rail division reported 1986 net
  income of 119.4 mln dlrs, compared with 133.4 mln dlrs in 1985.
  It said grain traffic recovered from drought-affected levels of
  a year ago but was offset by weakness in other traffic areas
  and increased expenses.
      It said the net loss from its Soo Line increased to 33.5
  mln dlrs loss from 8.7 mln dlrs loss in 1985, mainly due to
  restructuring charges.
      Canadian Pacific said favorable developments during the

      Keller said that she expects the company's 1987 earnings to

      In addition, Keller said, the company is selling more of
  its expensive model cars, which are more profitable.
      The non-automotive operations, including Ford Motor Credit,
  are also expected to post improved earnings this year.
      Keller said she expects the company to split its stock and

      Bank of New York and the partners will retain about 10 pct

      RMJ is the holding company of RMJ Securities, one of the
  largest U.S. Government securities brokers.
      It is also involved in broking notes, obligations and other
  instruments sponsored by U.S. Federal agencies.
      Lacy said Exco had been considering buying a U.S.
  Government securities broker for the past four years and had
  made an offer for RMJ when it was sold by Security Pacific Corp
  &lt;SPC.N> in 1985. RMJ was then valued at about 50 mln dlrs.

1939,2,"CHRYSLER &lt;C> AMC BUYOUT VALUED AT 1.55 BILLION
  Chrysler Corp's proposed acquisition of
  American Motors Corp is valued at about 1.55 billion dlrs,
  including the cost of acquisition and the 767 mln dlrs in
  American Motor' debt that Chrysler will assume, analysts said.
      They said Chrysler's cost of acquisition was valued at  782
  mln dlrs, paid in cash, notes and Chrysler shares.
      The analysts told Reuters that at a New York briefing
  Chrysler treasurer Fred Zuckerman outlined his company's
  agreement with Renault to assume AMC's debt as well as 332 mln
  dlrs in unfunded pension liabilities, though the latter is not
  included valuing the transaction.
      Analysts were generally positive on Chrysler's proposed
  purchase of its much-smaller rival, but said they expected the
  transaction would carry with it a short-term dilution in
  Chrysler's earnings.
      A Chrysler financial source, speaking anonymously, told
  Reuters that the proposed purchase price was smaller than it
  would have been had a deal been struck last year because the
  impact of the new U.S. tax law removes Chrysler's ability to
  assume AMC's large reserve of tax-loss carryforwards
  accumulated from its losses since 1980.
      ""There were very serious discussions last fall but we
  didn't pull it off,"" the source said in a reference to the
  assassination in November of former Renault chairman Georges
  Besse.
      ""It's too bad because the tax benefits fell on the floor.
  And Renault could have gotten a much better price if we'd done
  it before the end of last year.""
      In addition to AMC's debt and its pension liabilities, the
  source said Chrysler would also assume any liability from
  lawsuits over the safety of Jeeps, which he called ""an overhang
  to the company.""
      Analysts quoted Chrysler officials as having told them that
  the deal includes payment to Renault of 200 mln dlrs principal
  in the form of a 10-year note at eight pct interest, 35 mln
  dlrs cash for Renault's equity in AMC's finance subsidiary, 25
  mln dlrs in cash for ""transaction fees"" in connection with the
  acquisition and 522 mln dlrs worth of Chrysler stock to be paid
  AMC shareholders.
      ""The big number is the 767 mln dlrs in debt assumption,""
  analyst Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co told Reuters.
       Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade 12
  billion dlrs of Chrysler Corp and unit debt due to the deal.
       But the Chrysler source said that in assuming AMC's
  liabilities, his company will refinance at a lower rate any AMC
  debt that is being carried at ""non-market"" rates.
      He said there were difficulties in negotiating with the
  previous Renault management on the acquisition because they
  were committed to the group's business plan of which AMC was an
  integral part.
      ""The new management didn't have that problem - AMC wasn't
  their baby,"" he said.

  Financier Carl Lindner, who holds a

  possibility of seeking control of it.
      Lindner, the Cincinnati, Ohio, investor who controls
  American Financial Corp, said his talks with some of Taft's
  managers and directors have been aimed at ""achieving an
  increased ownership position"" in the company.
      Lindner said his increase in ownership would be made either
  by making an offer to acquire control of Taft or taking part in
  a group to acquire the company.
      Lindner, who holds his Taft stake through American
  Financial and its subsidiaries, said he is also considering
  buying more Taft stock on the open market or in private deals.
      He did not say whether the talks with Taft officials led to
  any agreements or understandings.
      But Lindner said he intends to review his investment in
  Taft and may be involved in further talks or take other steps
  regarding the future control and direction of Taft.
      Lindner's investor group recently raised its Taft stake to

  pct, after buying 49,800 shares for a total of 5.8 mln dlrs.
      Although he recently received clearance from the Federal

  Lindner in previous SEC filings has always stressed that his
  interest in Taft was for investment only and not was not

1965,1,"ULTRAMAR SAYS FOURTH QUARTER SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS
  Ultramar Plc &lt;UMAR.L> said that while
  its fourth 1986 quarter had improved from the operational point
  of view, several special charges adversely affected results.
      Overall the year had not been a good one, with upstream
  operations dramatically hit by the fall in crude oil prices and
  downstream operations also affected in the first half by large
  losses on inventories.
      But margins improved in the second half and in particular
  refining and marketing in Eastern Canada showed a good
  recovery.
      The company was commenting on results that showed a net
  loss for the year of 62.1 mln stg after a 71.6 mln profit in
  1985.
      The fourth quarter charges included a 20.8 mln stg
  provision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialled
  by Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the company's liquid
  natural gas and 4.7 mln for the early months of its ownership
  of Gulf Canada's marketing assets.
      Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of a
  further reorganisation programme, which was partly offset by a
  withdrawal of surplus funds from U.S. Pension schemes, and a
  13.5 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling its
  U.S. Flag shipping operation.
      The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertain
  although it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increase
  in the near term. However, Ultramar said it was optimistic
  prices would strengthen over the longer term.
      Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas put
  it in a good position to benefit from any price recovery.
      In the meantime, Ultramar's objectives were to improve
  profitability by selling or restructuring weak operations while
  strengthening core businesses and developing a sound
  operational and financial base.
      Proven, probable and possible reserves at end-1986 totalled
  about 700 mln barrels net on an oil-equivalent basis.
      Ultramar shares firmed on the announcement to 187p from
  181p at last night's close.

      But profits ""will be at a satisfactory level,"" the company
  said in the annual report without giving a specific estimate.
      Highveld said it expects appreciation of the rand will be
  offset to some extent by increasing U.S. Dollar prices for its
  exports as the year progresses.
      Highveld said measures taken last year by the European
  Economic Community and the United States prohibiting all South
  African steel products ""presents a challenge to management to
  place the steel in other areas.""
      The company said overall world vanadium consumption in 1987
  is expected to be similar to last year although China's role is
  still an unknown factor in the total supply-demand situation.
      ""World vanadium production capacity is still believed to be
  adequate to cater for any foreseeable demand,"" it added.
  

"
1968,1,"PREUSSAG SAYS PAYMENT OF A 1986 DIVIDEND NOT CERTAIN
  A spokesman for Preussag
  AG &lt;PRSG.F> said it was not yet certain whether the company
  would pay a dividend on 1986 results
      He was commenting on a Preussag statement which said
  results in 1986 were lower than in 1985. Preussag has
  frequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986
  following a difficult year in 1985.
      Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said in
  December the board would prefer to stick to its policy of not
  dipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted the
  final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board.
      The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared
  with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil and
  shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in
  the group's other divisions.
      The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic
  group would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would depend
  partly on the level of provisions.
      Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine
  marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped
  to 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before.
      The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marks
  in 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before.
  Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln.
      The statement said its results in 1986 were affected by
  unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by
  poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector.
      The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter
  of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an
  additional factor behind the drop in results.
      Preussag said rationalization measures already introduced
  would not begin to take full effect until this year.
      Preussag's domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billion
  marks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the first
  time consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from its
  majority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG.
      Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone
  was 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparison
  figures.
      Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0
  pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production rose
  to 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes.
      Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC)
  subsidiary, whose results are included in the world group
  accounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of
  last year.
      AMC's large losses in 1985, caused principally by the
  international tin crisis, were the reason behind the world
  group losses that year.

  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd &lt;HWHH.HK>
  expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higher
  dividend for the year, chairman Li Ka-shing said.
      He did not make any specific projections for the company's
  earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of
  not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed
  four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue.
      It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year,
  equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and share
  split.
      Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading to
  property and container terminals, earlier reported after-tax
  profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985.
      The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln
  dlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South
  China Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper,
  compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it
  expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the
  remaining shares.
      Li said Hong Kong's property market remains strong while
  its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely
  export-led growth.
      Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year
  against an initial government projection of 4.5 pct.
      But he said Hong Kong's large trade deficit with the U.S.
  May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affect
  the British colony.
      He said all of the company's major operations showed
  improved results in 1986.
      Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct
  interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd &lt;HKEH.HK> to
  &lt;Cavendish International Holdings Ltd>, itself a spin-off from
  Hongkong Electric.
      Under a reorganisation announced separately, Hongkong
  Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related
  activities into Cavendish, which will be listed on the local
  stock exchange. Hongkong Electric shareholders will receive one
  share in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share.
      Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares
  from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares.
      The spin-off and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares will
  give Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish.
      Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieve
  Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for
  making risky investments. But he denied there was pressure from
  the government for the spin-off.
      He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assets
  and will be almost debt free, with 340 mln dlrs of liabilites.

1976,1,"CREDITANSTALT SEES HIGHER 1987 DIVIDEND
  Creditanstalt-Bankverein &lt;CABV.VI> is
  likely to raise its 1987 dividend from the 1986 payment of 12
  pct of share capital, deputy general-director Guido
  Schmidt-Chiari said.
      The 1985 dividend was 10 pct, unchanged from the previous
  year and Schmidt-Chiari noted that the parent bank's share
  capital had risen to 3.1 billion schillings at the end of 1986
  from 2.7 billion a year earlier.
      Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference when
  the bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profit
  of 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985.
      Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast.
      The banking group's consolidated balance sheet total rose
  to 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion.
      General director Hannes Androsch said higher investment
  would lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Last
  year's better profits had resulted from improvements in
  services provided by the bank and also in profits on schilling
  lending.
      Schilling lending had grown last year and interest rate
  margins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory when
  compared with those in other countries, he said.
      Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home and
  abroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits,
  Androsch said, but declined to give an exact figure.
      Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business had
  fallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations,
  removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheet
  total.
      In an attempt to generate more foreign business,
  representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, Hong
  Kong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans to
  abolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares and
  drawing dividends.
      Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt rose
  eight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokers
  said improved results had been widely expected by investors.
      Androsch said industrial holdings had performed better in
  1986 than in previous years, giving a return on investment of
  2.6 pct compared with 1.3 pct in 1985. Creditanstalt, Austria's
  largest bank, holds majority interests in 10 medium-sized and
  large Austrian companies.
      But he forecast its biggest industrial subsidiary, Steyr
  -Daimler-Puch AG &lt;SDPV.VI> would return a 1987 result similar
  to the expected 1986 operating loss of 700 mln schillings.

  Hughes Tool Co said its board voted at

      The agreement, approved by the U.S. Department of Justice

  months instead of three to sell certain assets.
      The pact also allows a three-month extension, if warranted,
  and limits the obligation of the new company to give financial
  support to the businesses to be divested, pending their sale.
      The company said its board recommended that shareholders

  be resumed this afternoon, it said.
      ""Hughes will work with Baker and the Justice Department

2002,1,"OUTOKUMPU RESTRUCTURES COPPER DIVISION
  Finland's mining and metals group
  Outokumpu Oy &lt;OUTO.HE>, which last week reported a 1986 loss of
  83 mln markka after three successive years of profits, said it
  restructured its key copper processing division in an attempt
  to rationalize production and improve profitability.
      Outokumpu's Managing Director Pertti Voutilainen told a
  news conference the reorganization involved a split of the
  division into a new independent division with six profit
  centres.
      Outokumpu group had a 1986 loss before appropriations and
  taxes of 83 mln markka after a profit of 355 mln in 1985. It
  had profits in 1984 and 1983 but a loss, 171.2 mln, in 1982.
      Outokumpu acquired two Swedish copper manufacturers in
  January 1986, &lt;Metallverken Ab> and &lt;Wirsbo Bruks Ab>, that
  were merged into its copper processing division.
      The division had a turnover of 3.2 billion markka last
  year, 42 pct of Outokumpu's group turnover of 7.58 billion.
      The new Outokumpu division, called Copper Products
  Industry, is to incorporate Outokumpu's copper production
  plants, including its two U.S. Subsidiaries &lt;Nippert Co> and
  &lt;Valleycast Inc>, as well as Metallverken and part of Wirsbo.
      Outokumpu is planning to make Wirsbo an independent
  division in the Outokumpu group and transfer only Wirsbo's
  copper tube production into one of the new division's profit
  centres. A definite decision on Wirsbo will be taken later this
  year.
      The new division will have production plants in Finland,

"
2004,2,"AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> VIEWING SHEARSON OPTIONS
  American Express Co, rumored to be
  considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc,
  said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit
  that could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meet
  broadening international competition.
      In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson said
  the actions under consideration are an integral part of
  American Express' worldwide financial services strategy and
  that the two companies have been having both internal and
  external discussions on the matters.
      American Express said no decision has been reached on the
  strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately
  decide to follow growth plans already in place.
      Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that the
  financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of
  Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering
  selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the
  speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of
  the profitable brokerage firm to the public.
      There was some speculation that American Express had also
  considered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was
  considered highly unlikely, analysts said.
       American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it
  will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman
  would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained
  silent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American
  Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it
  to a Friday close at 74.
       It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a
  similar statement was being circulated to employees.
      Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for
  American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned
  brokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50
  pct in the last year.
      Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning
  off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock
  price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.
       Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express'
  1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.
      American Express' ambitious plans for international growth
  may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part
  of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of
  Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.
      To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling.
  ""(American) Express is in a position where they can raise
  capital if they need to,"" said Larry Eckenfelder of
  Prudential-Bache Securities.
      Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of
  Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey
  Lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.
       The reorganization also created four new positions for
  chairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analysts
  speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company.
       Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does
  little to clarify last week's market speculation. It does
  confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which
  unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major
  acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for
  growth and positioning in the global market competition.
      Late last year, Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F.
  Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said
  there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when
  it approached another major Wall Street brokerage.

2018,2,"CHRYSLER &lt;C> DEAL LEAVES UNCERTAINTY FOR AMC WORKERS
  Chrysler Corp's 1.5 billion dlr bid to
  takeover American Motors Corp &lt;AMO> should help bolster the
  small automaker's sales, but it leaves the future of its 19,000
  employees in doubt, industry analysts say.
      It was ""business as usual"" yesterday at the American Motors
  headquarters, one day after the proposed merger was unveiled by
  Chrysler and AMC's French parent Renault, according to company
  spokesman Edd Snyder.
      But AMC's future, to be discussed at a board meeting today,
  would be radically different as a Chrysler subsidiary than if
  it had continued with the state-run French car group as its
  controlling shareholder.
      Industry analysts said the future of AMC's car assembly
  plant in Kenosha, Wis., and its Toledo, Ohio, Jeep plant would
  be in doubt if the overcapacity predicted in the North American
  auto industry by the early 1990s comes to pass.
      Both plants are far from ""state of the art"" for car
  manufacturing sites, and AMC has a history of poor labor
  relations at each.
      ""Chrysler doesn't need that many new plants,"" said Michael
  Luckey, automotive analyst for the Wall Street firm Shearson
  Lehman Brothers. ""They probably will close the Toledo plant and
  move Jeep production to Canada.""
      Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said that at the
  very least, the new owner of the Toledo plant would be able to
  wring concessions from the United Automobile Workers union
  local representing Jeep workers.
      ""The UAW won't be able to hold them up for ransom as they
  have AMC because during a down year, Chrysler will have
  underutilized facilities to transfer production,"" he said.
      Analysts said they foresaw no major complications that
  would abort a combination which historians said would be the
  auto industry's biggest merger since American Motors was formed
  in 1954.
      AMC was in need of a financial savior because of its losses
  of more than 800 mln dlrs since 1980 and pressures in France
  for Renault to cut its backing. The company had said it could
  not forecast consistent profitability until 1988 at the
  earliest.
      In announcing the takeover agreement, Chrysler chairman Lee
  Iacocca cited AMC's Jeep division as well as its new 675 mln
  dlr assembly plant at Bramalea, Ontario, and its network of
  1,200 dealers as the major attractions.
      Analysts reasoned that Chrysler might feel moved eventually
  to sell off or close some of the older plants to cut overhead
  costs in view of the new debts and liabilities it would incur
  in the AMC buyout.

  J.C. Penney Co's stock rose sharply 
  after analyst William Smith of Smith Barney recommended the
  stock, based on the company's strong earnings momentum and the
  possibility of a stock buyback, dividend hike or stock split,
  traders said.
      ""I am very impressed with the strong basic earnings story,""
  analyst Smith said, noting that the company has ""fine tuned its
  buying and inventories, and has admirably controlled costs in a
  time that they needed to.""
      The stock jumped 2-1/2 to 98-3/4.
      Smith said the company ended 1986 with a strong cash
  position of about 639 mln dlrs as compared to 158 mln dlrs the
  year before. ""This implies the possibility of a share buyback,
  or significant dividend increase or a stock split,"" he said.
      In addition, he said the company has been gradually
  adjusting its merchandise mix and its gross margins have been
  improving.
      Smith expects the company to earn 8.25-to-8.50 dlrs a share
  in 1987 as compared to the 7.06 dlrs a share earned last year.
  Last year's results include a 69 cent charge for the buyback of

  The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)

  to seek advance clearance from the DOJ or the Federal Trade
  Commission for his extensive open-market purchases of USAir
  Group Inc &lt;U> stock, a DOJ official told a Senate panel.
      ""This is a matter that is being looked into,"" Charles Rule,
  acting assistant attorney general-antitrust, told the Senate
  Judiciary Committee's Antitrust Subcommittee.
      Rule declined further comment while the review was
  continuing.
      Rule was responding to panel Chairman Howard Metzenbaum
  (D-Ohio), who had asked why the department was not acting
  against ""what appears to be a clear violation of the law.""
      Metzenbaum said Icahn had failed to file a pre-merger
  notification form with the FTC prior to purchasing more than 15
  mln dlrs' worth of USAir stock.
      But Rule said that, for airline companies, a purchaser
  would be exempt from the requirement if it instead had filed a
  merger application with the U.S. Department of Transportation.
      Icahn filed such an application with the DOT, but the
  filing was thrown out by the DOT on Friday.
      The DOT threw out the application late Friday on grounds it
  lacked the necessary data for the government to review the
  proposed USAir takeover bid.
      Icahn refiled a more complete application form Monday.
      Rule pledged to act against Icahn and TWA if a violation
  were found.

2044,2,"PUROLATOR &lt;PCC> IN BUYOUT WITH HUTTON &lt;EFH>
  New Jersey-based overnight messenger
  Purolator Courier Corp said it has agreed to be acquired for
  about 265 mln dlrs by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc
  and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business.
      Analysts have said that Purolator has been for sale for
  some time. Purolator announced earlier it was mulling a
  takeover bid, but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was from
  another courier company.
      Hutton LBO, a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group
  Inc, will be majority owner of the company.
      Hutton said the acquiring company, PC Acquisition Inc, is
  paying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator's stock
  in a tender offer to begin Thursday. The rest of the shares
  will be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a
  subsidiary of PC Acquisition, containing Purolator's U.S.
  courier operations.
      If all the shares of Purolator are tendered, shareholders
  would receive for each share 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in
  debentures, and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PC
  Acquisition containing the U.S. courier operations.
      Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mln
  dlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PC
  Acquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock of
  the PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valued
  the warrants at two to three dlrs per share.
      Purolator's stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday.
  While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid
  30s, at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs.
      This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreed
  recently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for
  170 mln dlrs, and previously sold its auto filters business.
      Purolator retains its Stant division, which makes closure
  caps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said the
  firm is reviewing its options on Stant.
      Purolator's courier business has been lagging that of its
  U.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past
  several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet.
      E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to
  complete the transaction. This so-called ""bridge"" financing
  will be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the
  form of bank loans, Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed to
  keeping the courier business, its president Warren Idsal said.
      ""Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years
  largely due to U.S. courier operations, which we believe the
  management is turning around. We belive it will be a very
  serious competitor in the future,"" said Idsal.
      William Taggart, chief executive officer of U.S. Courier
  division, will be chief executive officer of the new company.
      The tender offer will be conditioned on a minimum of two
  thirds of the common stock being tendered and not withdrawn to
  the expiration of the offer as well as certain other conditions.
      The offer will begin Thursday, subject to clearances from
  the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission and will expire
  20 business days after commencement unless extended.

  River Oaks Industries Inc said
  it agreed in principle to give control of the company to Benson
  Seizer, a New York investor, in return for 2.6 mln dlrs in
  capital.
      The company, a maker of mobile homes, said it terminated
  merger discussions with &lt;Nursing Centers of America>.
      River Oaks said it will place a 2.6 mln dlr convertible
  note with Seizer, who in turn will name six additional members
  to the company's five-member board. One of the new directors
  will take over as chairman and chief executive officer, River
  Oaks said.
      River Oaks said the note will be convertible into two mln
  shares of its common stock at one dlr a share. The company
  currently has 14 mln shares outstanding.
      The company said it will also grant Seizer an option to buy
  an additional 2.6 mln shares during the next four years at 1.25
  dlrs a share during the first year and 1.50 dlrs a share
  thereafter.
      The company said the money raised from Seizer will further
  strengthen its balance sheet and enhance its ability to seek
  selective expansion opportunities.
      Seizer is experienced in turnaround situations and is
  expected to take direct involvement in River Oaks management,
  said Charles F. DeGroot, who will remain a director of the
  company after giving up the post of chairman to one of Seizer's
  board nominees.
      Don Manning will cede his post as chief executive but will

2072,2,"BELGIAN MINISTER UNVEILS PRIVATISATION PLAN
  Belgian Budget Minister Guy
  Verhofstadt has proposed a plan to sell off shares in several
  state-owned enterprises, including national airline Sabena and
  the postal and telecommunications authority, government sources
  said.
      They said the plan could raise more than 25 billion francs
  in revenue over the next five years according to Verhofstadt's
  projections, helping the government to reduce its huge budget
  deficit, targetted this year at 418 billion francs.
      But the scheme had received a guarded reception from the
  Social Christian parties in Belgium's centre-right coalition
  when Verhofstadt unveiled it at a cabinet meeting yesterday.
      Discussion of the plan was likely to be long and difficult,
  the sources said.
      Verhofstadt proposes beginning the selloffs in the last
  quarter of 1987, with the sale of 30 to 40 pct of state
  investment company SNI. He expects the sale to raise three
  billion francs, they added.
      A 25 pct share in Sabena would be sold in mid-1989 for 1.5
  billion francs, while 50 pct of the postal and
  telecommunications authority would be sold off in two stages in
  mid-1990 and early 1992, raising at least seven billion francs.
      Also on Verhofstadt's list are the Maritime Transport
  Authority, leading gas distributor Distrigaz, CGER savings
  bank, CGER, and several other credit institutions.
      Le Soir daily quoted CGER vice-president Paul Henrion as
  expressing strong opposition to the privatisation of his bank.

2107,2,"WALL STREET STOCKS/TENNECO INC &lt;TGT>
  Tenneco Inc, a company that has long
  been rumored to be a takeover candidate, rose sharply today
  when speculation surfaced that investor T. Boone Pickens may be
  targeting the company for an acquisition, traders and analysts
  said.
      Tenneco spokesman Joseph Macrum said ""we have no comment to
  make whatsoever."" Pickens was not available for comment.
      Traders noted that activity in the stock increased today
  after a published report linked Pickens to Tenneco.
      Tenneco rose two points to 48-3/4.
      Paul Feretti, an analyst with New Orleans-based Howard,
  Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs, Inc, said he was not surprised at
  market rumors that Tenneco might be the target of a takeover
  attempt.
      ""It's pure market speculation that Boone Pickens and his
  group may be interested,"" Feretti said.
      ""But Tenneco would be a challenge to run because of its
  sheer size and diversity. Mr. Pickens is a man who likes a
  challenge.""
      Pickens, who made an unsuccessful attempt to take over
  Dallas-based Diamond Shamrock Corp &lt;DIA> last winter, has made
  no secret of his plans to acquire additional natural gas
  reserves in the belief that gas prices will stabilize sooner
  than oil prices. Tenneco holds natural gas reserves estimated
  in excess of 3.5 trillion cubic feet, analysts said.
      Feretti conservatively estimated Tenneco's breakup value at
  58 dlrs a share and said the company generated a cash flow of
  about 10 dlrs a share ""which is probably very attractive to
  Pickens."" Other analysts, however, estimate a breakup value
  well into the 60 dlr a share range.
      ""I strongly doubt that there is going to be any hostile
  takeover,"" Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's Houston-based analyst
  John Olson said, putting little credence in the rumors.
      ""Tenneco is a gargantuan enterprise with seven billion dlrs
  in long-term debt and preferred stock outstanding."" He said the
  buyer would also have to deal with ""the intractable problems""
  Tenneco faces with its farm equipment unit and energy
  businesses.
      Analysts suggested that Tenneco could use a number of
  defensive strategies to fend off an unwanted buyer, such as
  spin off some of its non-energy businesses directly to
  shareholders, buy back shares or create a limited partnership
  out of its natural gas pipeline interests.
      An analyst who asked to remain unidentified, discouraged
  the Pickens rumor. ""Pickens has a plateful already with his
  holdings in Burlington Northern and Amerada Hess,"" he said. ""I
  don't think he would be willing to take on Tenneco's problems
  with Case (the farm equipment unit), which has been losing
  about 180 mln dlrs annually and is worth less than a billion
  dlrs on the market today.""

  of par value voting stock to Placer Development Ltd for 37.1

  68 pct.
      The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and a
  vote by Equity minority shareholders at the April 23 annual
  meeting, the company said.
      Proceeds from sale of the shares, priced at 5.625 dlrs
  each, will be used to buy and deliver 4,985,000 ounces of
  silver to Placer, Equity said.
      Equity Silver said the silver remains to be delivered under
  its sale agreement with Placer, after delivery of its 750,000
  ounce minimum commitment for 1987.
      Equity said it arranged to acquire 4,985,000 ounces of
  silver at 7.40 dlrs an ounces, subject to selling the shares to
  Placer.
      Purchase and delivery of the silver to Placer will result
  in an after-tax gain of about 6.6 mln dlrs, Equity said.
      It also said the stock and silver transactions will create
  a 37,059,000 dlr fund out of which dividends will be paid when
  cash is available.
      The cash fund will enable Equity Silver to continue to pay
  dividends on its preferred shares and increase the likelihood
  that it may be able to pay dividends on its common shares, the
  company said.
      It did not elaborate on what common share dividends might
  be paid.
      The company normally pays quarterly preferred dividends
  totalling 619,000 dlrs from retained earnings, Equity Silver

      Equity Silver had retained earnings of 2,312,000 dlrs at

  cents a share this year after a one-for-four bonus issue and a
  four-for-one stock split.
      The company earlier declared total dividends equal to 15

  to Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd &lt;HKEH.HK> for one billion

  Dart Group Corp &lt;DARTA>, which wants
  to acquire Supermarkets General Corp for 1.62 billion dlrs, is
  not likely to give up without a fight if its target seeks
  another buyer, arbitrageurs said.
      Speculation that Dart's offer of 41.75 dlrs per share could
  be just the beginning of a bidding contest helped Supermarkets
  shares gain one to 42-1/8  on 2.3 mln shares.
      One rumor had Federated Department Stores Inc &lt;FDS> taking
  a look at Supermarkets General. ""Our policy is that we do not
  comment on any rumors or speculation of this nature,"" a
  Federated spokeswoman said.
      An arbitrageur noted that Dart, controlled by chairman
  Herbert H. Haft and his son Robert, last year raised its
  initial bid for Safeway Stores by approximately 10 pct when
  Safeway resisted.
      However, that company was later sold to a buyout group that
  topped the Hafts.
      If history repeats itself, the Hafts could raise their bid
  to 46 dlrs if they are rebuffed by Supermarkets General, the
  arbitrageur said. But another arbitrageur said the Hafts'
  present bid seemed ""quite fair."" He said the offer amounts to
  10 times after-tax-cash flow which is ""probably fully priced.""

2165,2,"HUGHES &lt;HT> APPROVES MERGER WITH BAKER &lt;BKO>
  An overwhelming majority of Hughes Tool
  Co shareholders approved a merger agreement with Baker
  International Corp based on revised terms that allow the
  companies additional time to sell a drilling bit business as
  required by the U.S. Justice Department.
       Hughes chairman William Kistler said the revised terms of
  the proposed consent decree also set a 10 mln dlr cap on how
  much funding the newly combined companies will have to spend on
  the disputed drilling bit business until it is sold.
      An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish a
  funding limit.
      The Baker-Hughes merger, which would would create a 1.2
  billion dlr oilfield services company, almost fell through
  earlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposed
  Justice Department consent decree that would have given the
  companies only three months to find a buyer for the Reed
  business.
      Baker said today it would withdraw the one billion dlr
  lawsuit it had filed to force Hughes to follow through with the
  merger.
      Hughes' Kistler, speaking to reporters after 85 pct of
  Hughes' shareholders approved the merger, said the revised
  terms of the agreement give the companies six months to find a
  buyer for the Reed drilling bit business. The previous
  agreement had proposed a three-month period.
      Kistler said the the government had also indicated it would
  consider granting, if necessary, an additional three-month
  extension to complete the sale.
      He said there were ""several people looking"" at the domestic
  drilling bit business.
      The companies, Kistler said, have also decided to
  voluntarily sell a Reed plant in Singapore.
      Kistler estimated that the merger, which should be
  completed in about two weeks, will result in annual cost
  savings of about 50 mln dlrs. He said he expects ""substantial
  cutbacks"" in the 20,000-member workforce at Baker-Hughes Inc,
  the name the merged company will take.
      Kistler said the cost savings and greater efficiencies
  should put the company on a profitable course. ""We think that
  in the third or fourth quarter after the merger we should see
  something close to breakeven,"" he said.
      In the fourth quarter of 1986, Hughes earned 31.7 mln dlrs
  on sales of 215.7 mln dlrs.
      Baker, in its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, lost
  34.2 mln dlrs on revenues of 297.7 mln dlrs.

  determination to remain an independent publishing enterprise.

  stretching back 200 years.
      He said as long as the company maintains copyrights with
  the estates of deceased authors, it controls all motion picture
  and television rights to the stories. And he said new printing
  technologies make new editions a profitable business.

  The Bank of England does not favour the
  introduction of rules to shield companies from hostile takeover
  attempts, its governor, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, said.
      Instead, merchant banks advising bidding companies must
  show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that
  have marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire and
  Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries' annual
  dinner.
      Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties
  with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of
  those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors
  of companies they invest in.
      ""Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators,
  for that is but a short step from saying that they should be
  protected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all,
  the proprietors of the company,"" Leigh-Pemberton said.
      He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to
  play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more
  efficient market penetration. ""The degree of success or failure
  (of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or
  not the takeover was contested,"" he said.
      Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover
  activity in the recent past. ""The aim is to pressurise a
  company's management into action dedicated solely to a
  favourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partly
  or even primarily at the expense of the future,"" he said.
      Such bids ""often depend for their success on creating a
  highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market,
  and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to
  engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are
  immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders,"" he
  said.
      In a clear reference recent events, he said ""those in the
  City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest,
  be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if
  it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result.""

2197,1,"SAUDI BANKS FACE FURTHER LEAN PERIOD
  Saudi Arabia's 11 commercial banks are
  reporting a further decline in profits for 1986 as increasing
  provisions have to be set aside to cover the burden of non-
  performing loans.
      Bankers in the Saudi capital said the need to build
  reserves for bad and doubtful debts may start to decline a
  little this year.
      But the kingdom's still sluggish economy and legal problems
  hampering traditional lending operations mean earnings will
  remain vulnerable.
      One senior bank credit officer said ""The work is largely
  done in terms of identifying bad loans and making provisions,
  but banks are still going to face difficulties earning money.""
      The sudden decline of Saudi Arabia's corporate sector in
  1983 - culminating in a number of debt reschedulings - has
  taken a heavy toll of bank profits, with first results now
  appearing for 1986 showing a fourth successive year of broad
  decline.
      The cumulative net 1985 earnings of the kingdom's banks had
  sunk to 827.9 mln riyals from 2.66 billion in 1982 before world
  oil prices tumbled.
      Of the kingdom's nine joint-venture banks which operate on
  the Gregorian calendar year, four have already reported and
  revealed a further profits decline - or net loss - for 1986 at
  the expense of increased provisions.
      The newest and smallest of the joint ventures, &lt;United Saudi
  Commercial Bank> (USCB) reported a 1986 net loss of 15.9 mln
  riyals, marginally less than 1985's shortfall of 17.0 mln.
      Profits before provisions were sharply higher, in part
  reflecting an 18 pct staff cut last year. But the bank nearly
  trebled the amount set aside against bad and doubtful loans to
  60 mln riyals from 22 mln in 1985.
      Other results released so far show &lt;Saudi American Bank>
  (SAMBA) reporting a 53.8 pct fall in 1986 net profit to 80.7
  mln riyals, while &lt;Al Bank Al Saudi Al Fransi>, known as Saudi
  French, slid 14 pct to 94.9 mln riyals.
      Both Saudi American, owned 40 pct by Citicorp's &lt;CCI.N>
  Citibank NA and Saudi French, 40 pct owned by Banque Indosuez,
  increased provisions sharply.
      &lt;Arab National Bank>'s net profit fell 17.8 pct to 152.1
  mln riyals and provisions were more than doubled to 86.6 mln
  riyals.
      Bankers said there are first signs that the number of non-
  performing loans has stopped growing as the decline in the
  Saudi economy bottoms out.
      Few are willing to predict a sharp upturn in economic
  activity, but one banker said ""The top 50 pct of the Saudi banks
  are now at or close to international levels on provisions.""
      From 1982 to 1985, the kingdom's largest bank &lt;National
  Commercial Bank> (NCB) stashed away 1.7 billion riyals in
  provisions or 8.9 pct of its total loans and advances to the
  private sector, bankers calculated.
      Between 1982 and 1985, &lt;Riyad Bank>, NCB's rival as the
  second biggest of the two all-Saudi shareholding banks, had
  covered 12.8 pct of its loans and advances. Both banks operate
  on an Islamic year that does not coincide with the other nine.
      Although the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) has been
  tightening supervision, there is still no standardised rule for
  declaring loans as non-performing.
      Bankers say this makes comparison of profit figures
  difficult because some banks still book non-accruing interest
  as revenue while others follow more conservative practices in
  force in major world financial centres.
      Bankers generally said NCB, Riyad Bank and the
  joint-ventures SAMBA, Saudi French and Arab National Bank rank
  as the strongest earners.
      Other banks such as &lt;Saudi British Bank>, 40 pct owned by
  the &lt;British Bank of the Middle East>, are disadvantaged by a
  relatively low deposit base.
      Saudi British slashed 1985 profit 91 pct to just 9.1 mln
  riyals and 1986 accounts due soon are expected to show another
  low figure. But the bank has traditionally been one of the most
  conservative in making provisions.
      Bankers said SAMA has proved it is not prepared to see a
  Saudi bank go under and not only supported &lt;Saudi Cairo Bank>
  after its troubled 1985 accounts came to light but also made
  available cheap deposits to &lt;Saudi Investment Bank> and USCB.
      The banks can on-lend these to generate profit, but
  generally banks are awash with liquidity since they are
  unwilling to risk incurring fresh non-performing loans.
      And while banks in more liberal financial markets can
  attempt to diversify away from traditional lending,
  conservatism in Saudi banking has made it difficult to generate
  fee income from new investment banking products.
      One banker said ""Operating earnings in the Kingdom are not
  good.""
      Reflecting the caution in new lending, the amount of
  advances is showing a declining trend, while the days when
  banks had ample funds in interest-free current accounts to
  invest are disappearing as Saudi customers seek a better return
  on their money.
      In 1979, the ratio of interest-bearing accounts to current
  accounts was 27 to 73 pct. Today, only about 40 pct of customer
  funds are held on current account.

  the Nomura research institute said.
      Sales of all industries are predicted to rise 1.9 pct in

  Securities Co said in a statement.
      Recurrent profits were estimated to fall 20 pct in the

      Corporate efforts to cope with the yen's appreciation, such
  as cutting production costs, are expected to bear fruit next

  Swedish mining and metals group
  Boliden AB &lt;BLDS ST> forecast a return to profitability during

  a massive write-off.
      The company, which consolidated the Swedish wholesale and

  included restructuring costs and write-offs of 802 mln crowns.
      ""These costs have arisen as a results of a change of

  burdened the annual accounts,"" the company said in a statement.

  Pittston Co said it has
  tentatively agreed to acquire WTC International N.V. in a
  tax-free exchange of stock.
      Pittston said it agreed to exchange 0.523 common share for
  each of the about 8,612,000 WTC common shares outstanding.
      Pittston said WTC's three principal shareholders, who own
  62 pct of its stock, are parties to this agreement. They have
  granted Pittston the right of first refusal to their shares.
      WTC has granted Pittston an option to buy WTC shares equal
  to 18.5 poct of its outstanding stock. The agreement is subject
  to approval of both boards and WTC shareholders.
      Pittston said described WTC as a fast growing air freight
  forwarding company with operations throughout the world. Its
  revenues totaled nearly 200 mln dlrs in the year ended November
  30 and for the quarter ended on that date it earned 1.3 mln
  dlrs on revenues of 55.8 mln dlrs.
      Pittston said its Burlington Air Express subsidiary
  generates about two-thirds of its 450 mln dlrs in annual
  revenes with its domestic air freight services.

2203,1,"ROWNTREE REPORTS PRETAX PROFIT AT 84 MLN STG
  Rowntree Mackintosh Plc &lt;RWNT.L>
  announced it made a pretax profit of 84 mln stg in the 53 weeks
  ending January 3, 1987, compared with 79.3 mln stg in the
  previous year.
      Turnover was up to 1.29 billion stg from 1.2 billion. A
  final dividend of 9.2p was proposed, after a final 8.2p last
  year. Earnings per share rose to 35p from 34.8p.
      The results were broadly in line with market expectations,
  leaving shares at 499p in early trading, up one pence from
  yesterday's close, but slightly off pre-announcement opening
  levels.
      Profit on ordinary activities after tax was 66.2 mln stg,
  up from the previous year's 60.7 mln.
      The U.K. Remained Rowntree's largest centre for trading
  profits, accounting for 47.9 mln stg, up from 45.3 mln in 1985.
  Profit from its second largest geographical area, North
  America, slipped to 34.7 mln stg from 37.2 mln. North American
  profits were affected by the fall of the value of the dollar.
      Operations in continental Europe made 7.8 mln stg in
  trading profit, up from 3.4 mln, with 4.0 mln stg made in
  Australasia, up from 2.3 mln, and 11.3 mln stg from the rest of
  the world, against 13.1 mln in the previous year.
      Extraordinary items amounted to a 11.3 mln debit after a
  16.5 mln debit previously. A company spokesman said this
  represented additional provisions for the cost of
  rationalisation plans announced in earlier years.
      Rowntree expects North American operations will this year,
  ahead of company expectations, be of the same order as those
  from the U.K. And the rest of Europe combined, the statement
  said. A spokesman said no specific figures had been forecast.
      Acquisitions will continue to be sought worldwide,
  including further moves in the speciality retailing business
  which Rowntree first entered in 1983, the statement said.
      Rising profit from Europe this year was forecast by
  chairman Kenneth Dixon in a statement. He added the performance
  of seven businesses bought last year was encouraging.
      The U.K. Confectionery side gained market share and
  increased trading margins. The Sun-Pat British grocery concern
  increased profit and Rowntree's small health food business,
  Holgates, raised earnings 10-fold, the statement said.
      Offsetting factors included currency movements, which cost
  the company nearly 5.0 mln stg. Sales tax hurt Canadian profits
  on confectionery operations, and the company faced strong
  competition in the U.K. Snack and Mid East export markets.

  expects to announce satisfactory results for its 1986/87
  financial year ending March, chairman Sir George Jefferson said
  in a third quarter statement.
      Full year results will be published in June. In the 1985/86

  1.48 billion in the previous period.
      Jefferson said good progress was made in the latest nine

  level of calls during the recent strike by company engineers.
      The statement said a positive cash flow of 381 mln stg for
  the first nine months will diminish in the final quarter due to
  corporation tax and dividend payments.
      Earlier, the company reported third quarter pre-tax profit
  for the period ended December 31 of 506 mln stg compared with
  452 mln a year earlier. Nine month pre-tax was 1.51 billion stg

  Consolidated attributable net profit of

  Chairman Jerome Monod told a news conference.
      Group turnover should rise about seven pct from the 15.7
  mln reported for this year, while group investments should
  total around 1.8 billion francs, somewhat above the 1.3 billion
  annual average of the past three years, he added.
      Investments will be aimed mainly at developing the group's
  leisure industry, health and communications activities, Monod
  said.
      In the leisure sector the group planned a joint development
  with Club Mediterranee &lt;CMI.PA>, Club Med, of a 200 hectare
  pleasure park at Puisaye in the Yonne department of Eastern
  Central France, he said.
      Wholly-owned subsidiary Lyonnaise de Developpement

  planning of the development which would be leased to Club Med
  as operator of the complex, he said.
      He gave no financial details but said leisure sector
  investments would total about 100 mln francs over the next
  three years.
      Investments in the communications industry would go mainly
  to develop the group's cable television activities and its 25
  pct owned Metropole Television affiliate. Metropole recently
  won the concession to operate a sixth television channel in
  France.
      Financing requirement of Metropole would be about 700 mln
  francs over the next four years, of which Lyonaise des Eaux
  would provide about 175 mln, Monod said.
      Monod said Metropole aimed to win a 15 to 20 pct audience
  share and to capture about 10 pct of the national television
  advertising market.
      Total investment by the group in the communications sector,
  including cable activities, would be between 300 mln and 400
  mln francs over the next five years, mainly concentrated in the
  coming year.
      Investment in cable operations would total between 150 mln

2221,2,"LEIGH-PEMBERTON OPPOSES TAKEOVER PROTECTION RULES
  The Bank of England does not favour the
  introduction of rules to shield companies from hostile takeover
  attempts, its governor, Robin Leigh-Pemberton, said.
      Instead, merchant banks advising bidding companies must
  show restraint and responsibility to avoid the excesses that
  have marred recent takeovers, he told the Yorkshire and
  Humberside Regional Confederation of British Industries' annual
  dinner.
      Leigh-Pemberton also called on companies to improve ties
  with institutional investors, suggesting representatives of
  those institutions be granted seats on the boards of directors
  of companies they invest in.
      ""Boards cannot expect protection from unwelcome predators,
  for that is but a short step from saying that they should be
  protected from their own shareholders -- who are, after all,
  the proprietors of the company,"" Leigh-Pemberton said.
      He added takeovers and mergers had an important role to
  play in furthering economies of scale, integration and more
  efficient market penetration. ""The degree of success or failure
  (of a takeover) has not in my experience depended on whether or
  not the takeover was contested,"" he said.
      Leigh-Pemberton noted there had been excesses in takeover
  activity in the recent past. ""The aim is to pressurise a
  company's management into action dedicated solely to a
  favourable impact on the share price in the short-term, partly
  or even primarily at the expense of the future,"" he said.
      Such bids ""often depend for their success on creating a
  highly-charged and artificial situation in the share market,
  and give rise to temptations, on both sides of the battle, to
  engage in aggressive, even manipulative tactics that are
  immensely damaging to the interest of the shareholders,"" he
  said.
      In a clear reference recent events, he said ""those in the
  City who act for companies or individuals .. Must, I suggest,
  be ready to accept a full measure of responsibility -- even if
  it entails opprobrium -- for the transactions that may result.""
      They ""should exercise the most careful judgment at the
  outset with respect to the clients for whom they act and the
  activities contenplated. Those who sow wind cannot expect the
  whirlwind to visit elsewhere,"" he added.

2222,1,"JACOBS SUCHARD EXPECTS ANOTHER EXCELLENT YEAR
  Jacobs Suchard AG &lt;JACZ.Z> hopes for
  another excellent year in 1987 after a 27 pct increase in 1986
  net profit. Results in the first few months show it heading in
  the right direction, company president Klaus Jacobs said.
      The group reported 1986 net profit of 190.9 mln Swiss
  francs compared with 150.4 mln in 1985 and raised its dividend
  per bearer share to 160 francs from 155 francs.
      Jacobs said the increase in profit, which far exceeded the
  company's target of five pct real annual growth, had been made
  possible by restructuring measures introduced in January 1986
  which had also made some major acquisitions possible last year.
      Hermann Pohl, general director in charge of economic
  affairs, said the 2.7 pct decline in group turnover to 5.24
  billion francs was due to currency factors.
      A 5.2 pct negative currency influence was partially offset
  by growth in operations and by structural changes within the
  group.
      Turnover in the coffee business fell to 3.10 billion francs
  from 3.56 billion in 1985 while turnover in the chocolate
  sector rose to 2.14 billion francs from 1.82 billion. The
  tonnage sold in both sectors declined due to higher prices and
  lower consumer demand, especially in France and West Germany.
      Jacobs Suchard increased its market share in West Germany
  to 44.9 pct from 39.9 pct in 1985, largely as a result of
  acquisitions. Market share in France was little changed at 25
  pct against 25.3 pct.
      Pohl said the group's average tax rate rose to 32.5 pct
  from 28.8 pct because of the higher profits and despite
  write-offs on the losses of new acquisitions. A further
  increase in tax levels was expected in future.
      Taxes jumped 51.3 pct to 92 mln francs in 1986 from 61 mln
  the previous year.

  Southwest Realty Ltd said it believes it
  could make all of its scheduled montly debt service payments
  for 1987 despite the falloff in its rental operations, but
  making the payments would probably severely impair its
  liquidity and restrict its ability to maintain the quality of
  its properties.
      The company today reported a 1986 loss of 1,544,000 dlrs
  compared with a 1985 profit of 3,912,000 dlrs.
      Southwest said in addition to its monthly scheduyled debt
  service payments, a 1,743,000 dlr loan on one of its Houston
  properties is due to mature on April One.
      Southwest said a commitment to reduce the interest rate and
  extend the Houston loan for one year has been accepted.
      It said talks are underway with lenders on other Houston
  properties to obtain partial debt service moratoriums which, if
  granted, would cut 1987 cash deficits from 1986 levels.  The
  loan renegotiations could involve bankruptcy or other
  litigation connected with the specific properties involved and
  could involve the suspension of interest and principal payments
  to some of the lenders.  Southwest said if the attempts to
  restructure debt do not succeed, it could lose one or more of
  the properties.
      Southwest said the Houston properties made up about 10 pct
  of its current value equity as of December 31 of 14.20 dlrs per
  share, down from 16.68 dlrs a year before.
      The company said depending on the success of the talks and
  operating results for 1987, one or two more properties could
  become subject to similar negotiations.  The two additional
  properties comprised about 11 pct of its current value equity
  at year-end, Southwest said.

  Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige
  has asked the White House to consider blocking the planned
  Japanese acquisition of a major U.S. supercomputer and
  semiconductor manufacturer for national security reasons, U.S.
  officials said.
      The officials, who asked not to be named, said yesterday
  that Baldrige has ""serious concerns"" about the sale of Fairchild
  Semiconductor Corp. to Fujitsu Ltd., another major electronics
  firm.
      The officials told Reuters that if the sale went through it
  could leave the U.S. military overly dependent on a foreign
  /ompany for vital high technology equipment used in its
  advanced missiles, aircraft electronics and intelligence
  gathering.
      In addition, they said, the sale would also worsen the
  already strained trade relations between the U.S. and Japan
  stemming from the huge Japanese surplus.
      The White House Economic Policy Council would consider the
  sale in the coming weeks, they said.
      Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger's position was not
  immediately known but in the past he has opposed the transfer
  of high technology to foreign governments and companies.
      Supercomputers made by Fairchild and other U.S.
  manufacturers are widely used throughout the world, but none
  have been sold to the Japanese government or to Japanese
  government-run agencies and universities.

2237,1,"SAND TECHNOLOGY &lt;SNDCF> MULLING REVERSE SPLIT
  Sand Technology Systems Inc said it is
  considering a reverse stock split of at least one-for-10 and
  expects to report a second-quarter profit, compared to a loss
  last year.
      The stock consolidation ""is something we're discussing, but
  it's not definite,"" Sand Technology president Jerry Shattner
  told Reuters in an interview.
      A private placement recently brought the number of
  outstanding shares to 106 mln, up from 97.1 mln shares on July
  31, 1986, the fiscal yearend.
      ""The company has always had the aura of a penny stock,""
  Shattner said, adding that Sand plans, at some time, to apply
  for listing on the Montreal Stock Exchange.
      Shattner said the company expects to report a profit of
  five pct, or about 350,000 dlrs, on sales of seven mln dlrs,
  for the second quarter ended January 31. Results for the third
  quarter should be about the same as the second, he added.
      Last year, Sand lost 243,064 dlrs on revenues of 7,012,195
  dlrs in the second quarter.
      After ""a disastrous first quarter,"" Sand hopes to break even
  in the current fiscal year, Shattner said. The company has
  scaled back its sales forecast to about 25 mln dlrs, from the
  33.5 mln dlrs projected in December.
      The rapid appreciation of the Japanese yen against U.S. and
  Canadian dollars last year led to Sand's loss of 2.1 mln dlrs,
  or two cts per share, on sales of 24.9 mln dlrs.
      In the first fiscal quarter this year, the company lost
  1,350,387 dlrs, or one ct per share, on sales of 3,570,585
  dlrs.
      Shattner believes the company will post better results this
  year due to several factors.
      ""Last year, one of our biggest problems was we were buying
  products in Japanese yen. We now buy some products from Hitachi
  in U.S. dollars and the results are starting to show up in the
  second quarter,"" he said.
      Sand Technology sells, under its trademark, computer
  accessories such as disk drives, solid-state memory enhancement
  devices and printers manufactured by Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT> of
  Japan.
      Shattner said Sand's affiliate in Detroit, ST Systems Inc,
  is developing software that lets large maniframe computers
  handle large databases and share them between applications.
      It is also distributing a new product called Sapiens, which
  is artificial intelligence computer language for use by major
  corporations.
      The company has also reduced costs through some staff
  cutting and a switch to profit sharing plans for sales staff
  instead of straight commissions, Shattner said.
      And Sand plans to market a laser printer in the fourth
  fiscal quarter, Shattner said.

  K Mart Corp said its record fiscal
  1986 net earnings of 582.3 mln dlrs, a rise from 221.2 mln dlrs
  a year ago, marked a ""major turning point"" for the world's
  second biggest retailer.
      K Mart said the earnings rise for the fourth quarter ended
  January 28 to 285 mln dlrs from 10.5 mln dlrs resulted from 
  ""merchandising, refurbishing and expense control.""
      A year ago, K Mart took a charge of 239 mln dlrs for
  discontinued operations. Earnings from continuing retail
  operations in the quarter totalled 270 mln dlrs or 2.00 dlrs a
  share compared with 249.4 mln dlrs or 1.91 dlrs a year ago.
      K Mart Chairman Bernard Fauber said ""the success of these
  programs is better illustrated by the strong 35.9 pct increase
  in 1986 income from continuing operations before income taxes
  to 1.03 billion dlrs, the first time K Mart Corp has reached
  this milestone.""
      Sales for the 1986 fiscal year reached a record 23.8
  billion dlrs, an 8.1 pct rise from 22.04 billion dlrs the prior
  year. K Mart said 1985 was restated to account for discontinued
  operations. Comparable store sales rose 5.5 pct in 1986 over
  1985, it said.
      Fauber said the sales growth came from greater consumer
  acceptance of K Mart's apparel merchandise, ""a marked increase
  in hardline merchandise sales and a growing contribution from
  specialty retailing operations.""
      K Mart said its fourth quarter pre-tax income from
  continuing operations was 493 mln dlrs, a 32.3 pct gain from
  372.6 mln dlrs last year. It said sales in the period grew 8.8
  pct to 7.23 billion dlrs from a restated 6.65 billion dlrs in
  1985 with comparable store sales up 4.7 pct.
      K Mart said its effective tax rate rose in 1986 to 44.6 pct
  from 37.6 pct in 1985. But it said selling, general and
  administrative expense eased to 23.2 pct of sales from 23.7 pct
  in 1985.
      ""Our performance in 1986 marks a major turning point for K
  Mart,"" Fauber said in a statement.
      ""In the years immediately prior to 1986, we focused on
  changing the look of our stores and the structure of the
  company.""
      K Mart, he said, committed billion of dollars for store
  remodeling and installing a centralized point of sale system,
  upgraded its merchandise mix, acquired three large specialty
  retailers, divested underperforming businesses and restructured
  its long-term debt.
      ""We were forced to pay a temporary price in the form of
  slower earnings growth and a lower rating by the investment
  community. However, beginning with the fourth quarter of 1985,
  our improved performance is proof that our approach is correct
  for the long term,"" the K Mart chairman said.

2271,1,"PHILLIPS &lt;P> TO EMPHASIZE CASH FLOW TO PARE DEBT
  Phillips Petroleum Co will emphasize
  improving its short-term cash flow this year to pare its debt,
  C.J. ""Pete"" Silas, chairman, told Reuters in an interview.
      ""Our priority is to get cash flow increased from the assets
  already installed,"" he said, but he declined to estimate annual
  cash flow for 1987.
      Analysts estimate Phillips"" cash flow at over one billion
  dlrs for 1987, while long term debt, which resulted from
  restructuring to find off corporate raiders in 1985, hovers
  about 5.9 billion dlrs as of December 1986.
       Silas said Phillips hope to achieve its goal by raising
  the capital expenditures budget to develop its oil and gas
  properties.
      ""We plan to develop the properties with short-term high cash
  flow prospects,"" he said. He projected a capital expenditure
  budget of 730 mln dlrs, up from the 1986 expenditure of 655 mln
  dlrs.
      Nearly half of that will be spent on exploration and
  production, and most of that will be spend overseas, Silas
  said.
      ""Phillips' top priority in 1987 will be to get the
  waterflooding in Norway and jack up the (Ekofisk) oil fields to
  improve our ability to extract oil and increase earnings,"" Silas
  said.
       Phillips estimates that the project, which is expected to
  cost 1.5 billion dlrs, will increase recovery by 170 mln gross
  barrels of oil over a period of 24 years.
      Phillips is also pursue opportunities in China where Silas
  said he was seeking ""a modification of terms with the Chinese
  government to make oil discoveries (in the offshore Xijang
  fields) commercially viable.""
      In the U.S. Silas said Phillips hopes to get the Point
  Arguello, Calif., field started up by the fourth quarter. ""We
  expect to start up the first platform then,"" Silas said.
      But emphasis on short-term cash flow has also forced the
  company to part with several oil and gas assets.
      Phillips sold its interests in the T-Block in the U.K.
  North Sea and U.S. reserves totaling about 1.3 billion dlrs in
  1986 as part of a two billion dlrs asset sales program that is
  now completed, Silas said.
       ""We sold high cost producing assets. They were not good
  value for us but possibly so for someone else,"" Silas said.
      Silas said the 1986 assets sales will not affect earnings
  for the company.
      ""Everything we are doing is to manage our cash flow and we
  are using that to manage our debt. Even the asset sales, while
  regrettable, were necessary to reduce debt,"" Silas said.
      He said no asset sales are planned this year as long as oil
  prices don't fall sharply lower and stay at lower levels  for
  several months. ""Then, everyone would be looking at sales (of
  assets), and we're no different from the others,"" Silas said.
      In other areas, Silas looks for improved earnings from
  Phillips chemical operations, which provided 299 mln dlrs in
  earnings for 1986, up from 219 mln dlrs in 1985.
      ""This was our second best year pushed by a good supply and
  demand balance for products, low feedstocks and energy costs
  for our operations,"" Silas said, ""In 1987 we think the market's
  supply and demand balance will be just as good but feedstock
  and energy costs will rise due to price recovery.""

2285,1,"BRITISH TELECOM CAUTIOUS ON EARNINGS PROSPECTS
  British Telecommunications Plc's &lt;BTY.L>
  profit growth prospects for the coming years will be reduced by
  increasing competition and continued costs for replacing old
  telephone systems, deputy chairman Graeme Odgers said.
      Speaking at a news conference on the third quarter results
  which were released earlier today, Odgers said the company
  faced heavy costs for installing new digital telephone systems
  in Britain for three to five years.
      He said &lt;Mercury Communications Ltd>, a Cable and Wireless
  Plc &lt;CAWL.L> subsidiary, was becoming a significant competitor.
      Odgers said Mercury was seeking to make inroads into some
  of British Telecom's most profitable areas.
      One company official privately estimated that British
  Telecom still had a 99 pct share of the U.K. Telecommunications
  market but feared that this could slip to 95 or 90 pct.
      The recent two-and-a-half-week engineering strike, which
  lead to some disruption in service, could well have encouraged
  clients to consider using the Mercury system, Odgers said.
      However, he forecast that the last quarter's results
  overall should not be adversely affected by the walkout.
      He calculated salary savings as a result of the strike at
  50 mln stg and while loss of income on telephone calls should
  be limited revenue probably dropped on peripheral activities.
      But on balance Odgers said that group's financial strength,
  economies of scale and the fact that it operates in a growth
  industry will help produce annual profit increases for the
  forseeable future.
      British Telecom will also seek to expand into
  manufacturing, he said, adding that research and development
  expenditure will rise both in terms of value and compared with
  the current proportion of two pct of overall turnover.
      Analysts said the company's downbeat forecasts helped
  shares dip to 242p in mid-afternoon, down 4p from yesterday's
  close and off an early high of 248p.
      Philip Augar of stockbrokers Wood Mackenzie and Co Ltd said
  the market expects slower profit growth, but forecast a seven
  to eight pct rise in both earnings per share and pretax profit
  over the next two years. In the 1985/86 financial year, pre-tax
  profit rose to 1.81 billion stg from 1.48 billion.
      Augar noted that a government-imposed formula linking
  charges to inflation meant that the company's scope for raising
  prices was limited as long as inflation remains low.

  Cyacq Corp, an investor group
  bidding for Cyclops Corp, said it would raise its outstanding
  tender offer price for Cyclops common to 92.50 dlrs a share
  from 80 dlrs, if certain conditions were met.
      The increased offer would exceed the 90.25 dlrs a share
  price offered by Dixons Group PLC in a tender offer for Cyclops
  that is part of a definitive agreement to acquire the
  Pittsburgh-based maker of carbon tool and specialty steel
  products.
      Cyacq includes Audio/Video Affiliates Inc and Citicorp
  Capital Investors Ltd and other investors.
      Cyclops has about 4.1 mln shares outstanding.
      For the tender price to be raised, Cyclops must provide
  Cyacq with all non-public information provided to Dixons Group
  and Cyacq must be satisfied with financial projections made in
  offering material by Dixons based on the information, Cyacq
  said.
      Additionally, Dixon Group's rights to buy Cyclops common
  and its rights to fees or expenses if the Dixon-Cyclop merger
  agreement is broken must be rescinded, Cyacq said.
      Cyacq said financial projections it developed for Cyclops
  were materially lower than the financial projections provided
  by Cyclops to Dixons Group.
      A Cyclops spokeswoman said the company had no details of
  the new Cyacq proposal and could not comment. ""We have nothing
  in hand,"" she said.
      In addition to making specialty metal products, Cyclops
  also operates about 115 specialty stores that sell consumer
  electronics products. The stores are located in 17 states
  concentrated in the Northeast, Northwest and Southwest.
      Cyclops employs about 8,900 people in Pennsylvania, Ohio
  and other states. It also has interests in non-residential
  construction.
      In 1986, Cyclops earned 21.3 mln dlrs or 5.26 dlrs a share
  on sales of 1.5 billion dlrs, compared to 1985 earnings of 26.2
  mln dlrs or 6.20 dlrs on sales of 1.4 billion, the spokeswoman

  Union Pacific Corp said it will sign a
  pact in Caracas on March 17 with Petroleos De Venezuela, PDVSA,
  to sell the state owned company half of its Corpus Christi,
  Texas refinery owned by its Union Pacific's Champlin Petroleum
  Co subsidiary.
      The sale will also include the related marketing and
  distribution system for the refinery's products.
      A spokesman for the company said that a statement may be
  issued later today giving details of the transaction.
      There was no immediate comment from PDVSA officials in New
  York.
      The Corpus Christi refinery has a capacity of about 160,000
  barrels per day, the Union Pacific spokesman said, and is a
  largely upgraded facility but he would place no value on the
  transaction.
      The additional acquisition of refinery and distribution
  assets by PDVSA has been expected as Venezuela has been moving
  aggressively to enhance its role in the oil industry from
  producer to excpanding its presence in the downstream sector.
      Purchase of part of Champlin's operations also fits a
  profile which PDVSA officials have said previously they looked
  for in any acquisition.
      One PDVSA official said the company was looking for
  independent oil companies with good refinery and distribution
  network and a strong regional presence.
      The potential purchase of the interest in Champlin followed
  its earlier acquisition of a part interest in Southland Corp's
  &lt;SLC> Citgo Petroleum Corp subsidiary.
      In that agreement signed September 15, 1986, PDVSA paid
  Southland 290 mln dlrs for half of Citgo's stock.
      The potetnital acquisition of half Champlin's Corpus
  Christi plant will also give Venezuela an additional outlet for
  its crude oil production while giving the refiner an assured
  source of supply, trade sources said.
      In the earlier deal with Southland, PDVSA agredd to to
  supply Citgo with at least 130,000 bpd of crude oil and other
  feedstocks.

  A Purolator Courier Corp director
  resigned from the company's board, saying he plans to take

  deal already accepted by Purolator's board, the company said.
      The director, Doresy Gardner, resigned in a March 10 letter
  to the Purolator board, which was included in a filing made by
  the company to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
      Gardner noted that the terms of the merger agreement in
  which the company would bought out by a group of its managers
  and E.F. Hutton LBO Inc bar directors from taking action to
  solicit, initiate or encourage acquisition proposals.
      ""I, as a shareholder, wish to solicit, initiate or
  encourage such an offer or indication of interest, and believe,
  therefore, that I should resign as a director of the
  corporation,"" Gardner said in the letter.
      ""Accordingly, I hereby resign as a director of Purolator
  Courier Corp, effective immediately,"" he said.
      Gardner said he believes shareholders could get a better
  deal than the buyout offer if the company would agree to be
  sold to some other entity, or if it could sell off all or part
  of its U.S. courier division.
      On March 4, another Purolator shareholder, Rodney Shields,
  filed a class action suit on behalf of the company's
  shareholders charging the company and its board with breaching
  their fiduciary duty by failing to take steps to ensure that
  shareholders got the highest possible price in the buyout.
      The deal would give shareholders 35 dlrs a share in cash if
  just 83 pct of Purolator's 7.6 mln shares are tendered. If more
  are tendered, they would receive 29 dlrs in cash and six dlrs

2380,2,"TALKING POINT/PUROLATOR COURIER CORP &lt;PCC>
  Purolator Courier corp's stock rose on
  specualtion that a disgruntled former Purolator director would
  find a new suitor for the company, traders said.
      Purolator agreed in late February to a 35 dlr-a-share, 265
  mln-dlr offer from E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain members of
  its Purolator courier division's management.
      The stock today hit 36-1/4, up one.
      Today, Purolator revealed in a filing with the Securities
  and Exchange Commission that director Doresy Gardner resigned
  from its board of directors in a letter dated March 10.
      The letter from Gardner said he resigned the board because
  the merger agreement with Hutton barred directors from
  soliciting new offers and he believes shareholders might get a
  better deal. Gardner said he believes a better offer might be
  found if the company would agree to be sold to some other
  entity, or if it could sell off all or part of its U.S. courier
  division.
      ""Basically, (the courier division) is a company that has
  450 mln dlrs in revenues. It's a very large company and it's
  being sold for 50 or 60 mln dlrs,"" said Gardner in a telephone
  interview with Reuters.
      Gardner is an official of Kelso Management, a firm
  associated with Fidelity International Ltd. A group of Fidelity
  companies owns eight pct of Purolator, and Gardner said he
  personally owns 20,000 shares.
      A Purolator official said the company has no comment on the
  letter from Gardner.
      Arbitragers speculated another overnight messenger service
  may emerge as a likely bidder for Purolator. Before the
  transaction with Hutton LBO was announced, analysts had also
  speculated another courier company would be the most likely
  suitor.
      While one arbitrager acknowledged there in fact may be no
  new bidders, he said the possibility one could appear pushed
  the stock into play again.
      ""There's no shortage of possibilities. It's just a question
  of management's willingness to let the process continue,"" said
  one arbitrager.
      Arbitragers said a new buyer might be found because they
  believe Hutton LBO has taken on no risk in the transaction.
  Hutton has begun a tender for 83 pct of Purolator at 35 dlrs
  cash per share. The balance of Purolator's stock will be bought
  for securities and warrants in a new company holding the U.S.
  courier operations.
      The arbitragers said tender offer documents show that
  Hutton does not need to use its cash in the transaction and
  will emerge with a giant, majority equity interest in
  Purolator.
      ""As far as I can tell from the public documents from the
  deal that's on the table, Hutton is basically putting up zero.
  One always likes a situation like that. You always like to
  think if they can do this deal at no risk, there should be
  someone else in the world that could do it higher,"" said one
  arbitrager.
      The firm, however, is supplying temporary financing, and
  sources close to the transaction disputed the claim that the
  firm will not end up paying for its equity position.
      While one scenario mentioned in the tender offer document
  did note that the E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary may not have to
  keep cash in the transaction, the sources said there is some
  risk to the firm.
      ""There are a variety of contingencies and restricted cash,
  and all sorts of things that make it very speculative,"" said
  one of the sources, adding there are also severance payments to
  employees.
      The E.F. Hutton Group subsidiary is supplying 279 mln dlrs
  in so-called ""bridge"" financing for the transaction. The bridge
  financing is a temporary loan from Hutton.
      The financing is to be replaced with permanent financing,
  expected to come from banks. However, it may take some time to
  replace the financing, the source said, resulting in what could
  be a substantial expense to the firm.
      Gardner said Hutton stands to gain fees of 10 to 20 mln
  dlrs from the transaction, but sources close to the transaction
  said fees are at the low end of the scale.
      ""It's a very complex transaction, but basically what
  happens is they ostensibly put up money but the fees recapture
  any investment they might have once the merger takes place,""
  Gardner said.

2381,2,"CONSOLIDATED TVX TO BUY BRAZIL GOLD MINE STAKES
  &lt;Consolidated TVX Mining Corp> said it
  agreed to issue 7.8 mln treasury shares to acquire interests in
  three gold mining companies in Brazil and an option to increase
  the company's interest in a platinum property.
      The company said the transactions will bring immediate
  production and earnings to Consolidated TVX, enhance its
  precious metal potential and is expected to improve cash flow
  and earnings on a per share basis. The company did not give
  specific figures.
      Consolidated TVX said it will acquire 29 pct of CMP, a
  public gold mining company in which TVX already holds a 15 pct
  interest, making TVX the largest single shareholder.
      The company also agreed to acquire a 19 pct stake in Novo
  Astro, a private company, and a 16 pct interest in Teles Pires
  Mining, increasing the TVX's ownership to 51 pct.
      In addition, Consolidated TVX said it will acquire the
  right to add a 10 pct interest to a platinum property in which
  it already owns a 29.4 pct stake.
      CMP earned 11 mln Canadian dlrs in 1986 and expects to
  produce 42,000 ounces of gold in 1987 at a cost of 160 U.S.
  dlrs an ounce, Consolidated TVX said.
      Novo Astro operates Brazil's richest gold mine located in
  Amapa State, with an average grade of 0.8 ounces of gold a ton
  in a hardrock quartz vein, Consolidated TVX said. Mining of
  eluvial surface material produced 25,000 ounces in 1986 and is
  expected to produce 60,000 ounces in 1987.
      It also said Teles Pires Mining controls rights to a 350
  kilometer section of the Teles Pires River, where one dredge is
  expected to produce 10,000 ounces of gold in 1987.

2387,2,"CHEMLAWN &lt;CHEM> RISES ON HOPES FOR HIGHER BIDS
  ChemLawn Corp &lt;CHEM> could attract a
  higher bid than the 27 dlrs per share offered by Waste
  Management Inc &lt;WNX>, Wall Street arbitrageurs said.
      Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in
  over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1
  mln shares changing hands by late afternoon.
      ""This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs,
  maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing
  bidder,"" an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer,
  announced before the opening today, expires March 25.
      ""This is totally by surprise,"" said Debra Strohmaier, a
  ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly
  scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management
  announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not
  certain when it would be ready. 
      She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact
  between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.
      ""I think they will resist it,"" said Elliott Schlang,
  analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. ""Any company that
  doesn't like a surprise attack would.""
      Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender
  offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn
  could try to find a white knight if does not want to be
  acquired by Waste Management.
      Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said
  ServiceMaster Companies L.P. &lt;SVM> or Rollins Inc &lt;ROL> were
  examples of companies that could be interested.
      ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S.
  company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and
  herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of
  wastes.
      Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to
  another company that wants to capitalize on a strong
  residential and commercial distribution system.
      Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had
  catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but
  the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.
      Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the
  fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for
  the full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter.
      Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of
  individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice.

  Allied-Lyons PLC &lt;ALLD.L> and Canada's
  Reichmann brothers are working well together as partners and
  currently do not plan any change in their joint ownership of
  distiller Hiram Walker-Gooderham and Worts, Allied-Lyons
  chairman Derrick Holden-Brown said.
      Allied-Lyons got 51 pct control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham
  last year for about 600 mln U.S. dlrs, while the Reichmanns'
  &lt;Gulf Canada Corp> acquired 49 pct in an out-of-court pact
  after a hostile battle for the wine and spirits division of
  &lt;Hiram Walker Resources Ltd>.
      ""We are getting along very well as partners ... I hope
  there won't be any change, but there could be,"" Holden-Brown
  told reporters after a speech in Toronto.
      He said Allied-Lyons has a two-year call option that could
  force Gulf Canada to sell its 49 pct stake to Allied-Lyons, and
  Gulf Canada has a two-year put option that could obligate
  Allied-Lyons to buy its 49 pct.
      ""Both we and Gulf hope very much there will be no occasion
  for either the put or call to be exercised,"" Holden-Brown said.
      In answer to a reporter's question, Holden-Brown said it
  would be possible for Gulf Canada to sell off part of its 49
  pct in a public offering with Allied-Lyons' consent. ""I don't
  think we would have any objection to it,"" he added.
      Allied-Lyons maintains control of Hiram Walker-Gooderham's
  board of directors and has total responsibility for its
  management. ""We cannot contemplate giving up our control,"" he
  said.
      Holden-Brown would not disclose how big a profit
  contribution the distiller will make in Allied-Lyons' financial
  results, but he said ""it will be substantial.""
      ""I am not able to give profit forecasts,"" he said.
      Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons was able to finance the
  Hiram Walker-Gooderham acquisition with cash and borrowings,
  and has no current plans for a stock issue.
      He said the company is not currently negotiating any more
  acquisitions in Canada but has a team of officials evaluating
  possible purchases of wines, spirits, soft drinks or food
  concerns. ""I don't think we shall be looking at the brewery
  scene (which is) highly concentrated already,"" he added.
      Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons plans to list its shares on
  Canadian stock exchanges, possibly later this year.

2428,2,"JAPAN REJECTS U.S. OBJECTIONS TO FAIRCHILD SALE
  A Foreign Ministry official dismissed
  arguments made by senior U.S. Government officials seeking to
  block the sale of a U.S. Microchip maker to a Japanese firm.
      ""They appear to be linking completely unrelated issues,""
  Shuichi Takemoto of the Foreign Ministry's North American
  Division told Reuters.
      U.S. Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige has asked the
  White House to consider blocking the sale of &lt;Fairchild
  Semiconductor Corp> to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T>, U.S.
  Officials said yesterday.
      Baldrige expressed concern that the sale would leave the
  U.S. Military dependent on a foreign company for vital high
  technology equipment. Pentagon officials said Defence Secretary
  Caspar Weinberger also opposes to the sale.
      U.S. Officials have also said the sale would give Fujitsu a
  powerful role in the U.S. Market for supercomputers while
  Japan's supercomputer market remains closed to U.S. Sales.
      Takemoto said national security should not be an issue
  since the planned purchase of Fairchild from its current owner,
  Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>, does not include Fairchild's main
  defence-related division.
      In addition, Takemoto said tension over the supercomputer
  trade should not affect the sale as Fairchild does not make
  supercomputers.
      Analysts noted that Fairchild does make sophisticated
  microchips used in supercomputers. Fujitsu makes similar chips
  and supplies them to U.S. Supercomputer makers, they said.
      Takemoto also dismissed U.S. Fears that the proposed
  takeover would violate U.S. Antitrust law, saying ""the purchase
  would not result in Fujitsu monopolising the U.S. Semiconductor
  market.""
      Two separate issues appear to have come together to boost
  pressure to block the purchase, industry analysts said.
      The move is in part an attempt to force Japan to open its
  domestic market to more U.S. Supercomputer sales, they said.
      U.S. Officials have repeatedly charged that the Japanese
  public sector is closed to U.S. Supercomputer sales despite
  U.S. Firms' technological lead in the field.
      ""The United States believes Japan will only react when
  bullied, and this is a bullying ploy,"" Salomon Brothers Asia
  analyst Carole Ryavec said.
      However, the analysts said more is at stake than
  supercomputer sales as the U.S. Fears it is losing its vital
  semiconductor industry to Japanese competitors.
      ""The real issue is xenophobia in (the U.S.) Silicon Valley,""
  said Tom Murtha of brokerage James Capel and Co.
      U.S.-Japanese tension over the semiconductor trade has
  failed to subside despite recent efforts by Japan's Ministry of
  International Trade and Industry (MITI) to get Japanese firms
  to abide by a bilateral pact aimed at halting predatory pricing
  and opening Japan's market.
      A MITI official said that while Japan is faithfully abiding
  by the agreement, problems remain in halting the sale of
  microchips in Europe and Southeast Asia at prices below those
  set by the pact.
      ""It is only a matter of time before we solve this problem,""
  he told Reuters.
      Despite the furore, Fujitsu will proceed with talks on the
  acquisition in line with the basic agreement reached with
  Schlumberger last year, a Fujitsu spokeswoman told Reuters.

      He described the application as a precautionary move and

      Last week a spokesman said Mannesmann had a letter of

2432,1,"SCHWEIZERHALLE FIRE HIT SANDOZ 1986 PROFITS
  Sandoz AG &lt;SANZ.Z> would
  have reported a percentage rise in net profits ""close to double
  figures"" rather than the actual two pct had it not been for
  November's warehouse fire, a senior company official said.
      The official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters
  Sandoz had made a substantial addition to reserves to cope with
  the consequences of the accident at Schweizerhalle, which
  caused severe pollution of the Rhine.
      Sandoz today reported without comment a rise in net profits
  to 541 mln francs from the previous 529 mln and a five pct
  increase in dividend to 105 francs per 250 franc nominal share.
      This year began well, with the performance in January and
  February at least equal to the same period last year, the
  official said.
      The company is expected to give fuller details of its
  results at a news conference on April 22.
      Sandoz has insisted that it is adequately insured to cover
  any liability arising from the accident.
      The official said the addition to reserves was to cover the
  ""one pct"" of claims somehow not covered and any voluntary
  gestures it wanted to compensate for the effects of pollution
  from the fire.
      Sandoz has not given any figure for claims, which have been
  flowing in from Switzerland and other countries bordering the
  Rhine since the accident.
      However, the official said the final figure would be ""much
  less than that cited in earlier comments."" He gave no further
  details.
      In line with fellow chemical giant Ciba-Geigy &lt;CIGZ.Z>,
  which reported last month, Sandoz profit and turnover were also
  hit by the falling dollar, the official said.
      Sales in local currency terms were up by 14 pct, with
  market share increases in the United States and Japan. But this
  was more than offset by a 15 pct negative foreign exchange
  effect, which produced the reported one pct drop in turnover to
  8.36 billion francs,the Sandoz official said.
      Net profit at Ciba-Geigy dropped by 21 pct to 1.16 billion
  francs, while sales fell by 12 pct to 15.95 billion francs.
      The third major Swiss chemical company, F. Hoffmann-La
  Roche and Co &lt;HOFZ.Z> has not yet reported its results.
  

"
2433,1,"ALUSUISSE SEES POSSIBLE BREAK-EVEN IN 1987
  Schweizerische Aluminimum AG &lt;ALUZ.Z>
  (Alusuisse) may be able to break even this year after cleansing
  its balance sheet for 1986, chief executive Hans Jucker said.
      ""The threshold of profitability has returned to the
  foreseeable future,"" he said. ""We expect already in 1987
  approximately to break even. That presupposes, however, that
  our industrial environment does not worsen.""
      He said Alusuisse would no longer face the burden of past
  losses.
      Alusuisse made a net loss of 688 mln Swiss francs in 1986
  after a restated 756 mln loss in 1985.
      Gross sales were 5.93 billion francs after 8.51 billion and
  net turnover 5.65 billion after 8.00 billion.
      Alusuisse had originally reported a 692 mln francs loss for
  1985.
      But Jucker and Finance Director Hermann Haerri told a news
  conference the new management installed a year ago had decided
  to restate the previous five years' accounts to eliminate
  rights on Australian bauxite previously in the books as an
  asset.
      Together with other one-off charges, Alusuisse took an
  gross extraordinary charge in 1986 of 698 mln francs, up from
  472 mln in 1985.
      It also had 106 mln extraordinary income in 1986 remaining,
  after provisions, from the sale of its Maremont Corp subsidiary
  in the United States. There were no extraordinary gains in
  1985.
      Jucker said the losses, plus those carried forward from
  1985, had wiped out the company's remaining reserves and
  exceeded legally allowed levels, forcing Alusuisse to adopt a
  50 pct capital cut, to be approved by shareholders on April 22.
      Jucker said he knew shareholders would find this ""radical
  elimination of the mortgages of the past"" painful, but said the
  foundation had been laid for a successful new company strategy.
      Haerri said despite the losses, the company's liquidity was
  strong. Bank debt had been cut by about one-third to 2.56
  billion francs against the end-1985 level of 3.85 billion.
      Cash flow improved substantially to 323 mln francs from 111
  mln and represented 5.7 pct of turnover against a mere 1.4 pct
  in 1985.
      In addition, to reassure other creditors, Alusuisse had
  arranged with three major Swiss banks -- Union Bank of
  Switzerland &lt;SBGZ.Z>, Swiss Bank Corp &lt;SBVZ.Z> and Credit
  Suisse &lt;CRSZ.Z>, to convert 300 mln francs of credits into a
  subordinated loan.
      The main sources of losses in 1986 were book losses and not
  cash losses, Haerri said. Existing credit lines were used only
  to a small extent, and the parent company had been granted a
  new credit line of 200 mln francs from a consortium of Swiss
  banks that would cover most of the loans falling due in 1987.
      Haerri said the company had been criticized for maintaining
  bauxite rights as an asset, and so had restated the accounts.
      That left the 1985 account with a 756 mln franc loss
  instead of 692 mln, 1984 with a 68 mln profit instead of 169
  mln, 1983 with a 217 mln loss instead of 82 mln and 1982 with a
  479 mln loss instead of 179 mln.
      The new accounts show 1985 with shareholders' equity of
  1.15 billion francs instead of 1.75 billion, and similar
  alternations were made for previous years.
      After 1986 losses, shareholder's equity stood at only 895
  mln francs.

2434,1,"JAPAN CORPORATE PROFITS IN LAST 1986 QUARTER UP
  Current profits of Japan's major firms in
  the October-December quarter rose four pct from a year earlier
  to 5,654 billion yen against a 2.6 pct year-on-year rise in the
  preceding quarter, the Finance Ministry said.
      The improved earnings resulted mainly from a 22.5 pct
  profit increase in non-manufacturing industries, supported by
  an 88.7 pct rise for construction firms and a 138 pct gain in
  real estate, according to a ministry survey.
      Total sales of the 15,308 firms with capital of 10 mln yen
  or more which responded to the poll, fell one pct to 217,217
  billion yen against a 1.2 pct fall the previous quarter.
      Current profits of manufacturing industries in the fourth
  quarter dropped 13.7 pct to 2,394 billion yen against a 22.1
  pct fall in the preceding quarter, the ministry said.
      Plant and equipment investments of all firms polled fell
  3.9 pct to 8,004 billion yen, compared with a 1.4 percent fall
  the previoius quarter.
      Ministry officials said the survey showed that the Japanese
  economy is in a delicate stage in which it is hard to tell if
  economic growth has stopped deteriorating or if the economy is
  heading for a recovery.

  Caesars World Inc said its board
  unanimously rejected a 28 dlr a share takeover offer by New
  York investor Martin T. Sosnoff.
      Caesars said Sosnoff's offer to by all its outstanding
  shares of common stock was inadequate and not in the best
  interests of its shareholders.
      The company recommended that shareholders reject Sosnoff's
  offer, made through his &lt;MTS Acquisition Corp>, and not tender
  any of their shares.
      Caesars said it will explore a variety of alternative
  transactions but did not elaborate.
      Caesars, in a brief statement, did not say whether it would
  seek to buy back its shares held by Sosnoff.
      A Caesars spokesman said the company would not comment
  further on its decision.
      On Wednesday, Sosnoff told the Securities and Exchange
  Commission that he controls 13.6 pct of the company's stock.
      Sosnoff also informed the SEC that Caesars had offered to
  buyout his holdings several times during the past year.
      No one from the Sosnoff organization was immediately
  available for comment.
      Caesars said its financial advisor, Drexel Burnham Lambert
  Inc, had determined that Sosnoff's offer was financially
  inadequate for shareholders other than Sosnoff.
      The company said other factors it considered in rejecting
  the offer were its financial condition, future prospects,
  current market conditions and the numerous conditions on which
  Sosnoff's bid was conditioned.
      Caesars' stock opened up 1/8 point at 28-1/8. That is 1/8

      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  Metropolitan said it bought the Metex stock as an investment.
      It also said it may buy additional shares, or sell some or
  all of its current stake. If it buys more shares, Metropolitan
  said it would consider doing so in the open market, in private
  deals, or through an exchange offer, tender offer or merger.
      Metropolitan said it may acquire an option on or may buy
  some or all of the Metex shares owned by William Hack, a Metex
  director, who, together with this wife, holds 149,750 of the
  company's common shares, or 11.4 pct of the total.
      Metropolitan said it already has an option to buy another
  42,750 Metex common shares at 11.25 dlrs each. The option is
  not exercisable until April 12, 1988, it said.
      If Metropolitan were to exercise the option and acquire all
  of Hack's stake, it would have 471,208 Metex common shares, or
  35.9 pct of the total. Metropolitan's SEC filing was
  made as a shareholder group with Hack.
      Metropolitan, which said it spent 3.1 mln dlrs to acquire
  its Metex stake, listed its recent stock purchases as 54,993

2495,2,"BALLY &lt;BLY> CONSIDERING SALE OF SIX FLAGS
  Bally Manufacturing Corp said it is
  considering the sale of its Six Flag theme amusement park unit
  and would use the proceeds to pay off debt.
      In addition to the possible sale of the amusement parks,
  Bally plans to sell a minority stake in its health club chain
  to the public. The company will register a proposed offering
  with the Securities and Exchange Commission for 20 to 30 pct of
  the health clubs soon, spokesman William Peltier told Reuters.
      ""Selling Six Flags is definitely under consideration,""
  Peltier said in response to an inquiry. He said the company
  would use much of the income from the amusement park chain,
  were it to be sold, to repay debt.
      Six Flags might sell for as much as 300 mln dlrs, analysts
  said. The health club chain, the nation's largest, is valued at
  350 to 375 mln dlrs, they said.
      Bally reportedly already has been approached about Six
  Flags by several prospective buyers.
      The company needs the cash to begin paying back a 1.6 mln
  dlrs mountain of debt.
      Bally recently completed a 439 mln dlrs acquisition of the
  Golden Nugget casino hotel in Atlantic City from Golden Nugget
  Inc &lt;GNG.N>.
      The purchase pushed its long-term debt to 1.6 billion dlrs,
  or almost 2.7 times its equity of 600 mln dlrs.
      Bally's 325-unit health and tennis clubs had revenues in
  1986 of more than 450 mln dlrs, or about 28 pct of Bally's
  total revenues of 1.64 billion dlrs.
      Bally acquired Six Flags for 147.4 mln dlrs in January 1982
  from Penn Central Corp. Bally bought the Great America theme
  park in Gurnee, Ill., in May 1984 for 113.2 mln dlrs from
  Marriott Corp &lt;mhs>.
      In 1986 the parks had pretax operating profit of 48.6 mln
  dlrs on revenues of 369.4 mln dlrs.
      The clubs and equipment unit combined to post operating
  profit of 60.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 475.6 mln dlrs in 1986,
  of which 456.2 mln came from the clubs.
      The company earlier this month said it will take a charge
  to earnings in the first quarter of 17.3 mln dlrs as a result
  of its deal to buy back 2.6 mln of its common shares from real
  estate developer Donald Trump.
      Under a February 21 deal, Bally agreed to buy the 2.6 mln
  of the 3.06 mln shares held by Trump at 24 dlrs a share, or
  62.4 mln dlrs, plus 6.2 mln dlrs related expenses in exchange
  for Trump not seeking control of the company for 10 years.
      The deal also requires Bally to buy Trump's remaining
  shares for 33 dlrs a share if the stock price does not reach
  that level by February 21, 1988.

  Investor Sumner Redstone, who leads
  one of the two groups vying for control of Viacom International
  Inc, offered to sweeten his bid for the company by 1.50 dlrs a
  share cash and 1.50 dlrs in securities.
      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  Redstone, who controls Dedham, Mass.,-based National Amusements
  Inc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cash
  portion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs.
      Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock
  he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs.
      The Redstone offer, which is being made through Arsenal
  Holdings Inc, a National Amusements subsidiary set up for that
  purpose, which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of a
  share of Arsenal common stock after the takeover.
      Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids
  from Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc, a group led by Viacom
  management which is competing with Redstone for control of the
  company and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom.
      The company did not disclose the details of the revised
  offers, but said a special committee of its board would review
  them later today.
      The Redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom,
  and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have both
  agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is
  completed, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for
  at least half of the outstanding stock.
      The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements,
  which give them access to Viacom's financial records provided
  they keep the information secret.
      In his SEC filing, Redstone, who estimated his cost of
  completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said Bank of
  America is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs.
      Besides the financing it would raise through a bank
  syndicate, Bank of America has also agreed to provide a
  separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial
  financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs,
  Redstone said.
      Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increased
  its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated
  financing debt for the Viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrs
  it agreed to underwrite earlier, Redstone said.
      Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln
  dlrs in equity toward the takeover.
      The Redstone equity contribution to the takeover would
  consist of all of his group's 6,881,800 Viacom common shares
  and at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said.
      The new offer, the second sweetened deal Redstone has
  proposed in his month-long bidding war with management, also
  contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents, he said.
      Last week, the management group submitted what it called
  its last offer for the company, valued at 3.1 mln dlrs and
  consisting of 38.50 dlrs a share cash, preferred stock valued
  at eight dlrs a share and equity in the new company. Redstone's
  previous offer had been valued at 3.2 billion dlrs.

      Describing this as a major departure in the company's
  approach to commercial development, he told the annual new
  business forum of the Commercial Development Association ""We
  are looking to acquisitions and joint ventures when they look
  like the fastest and most promising routes to the growth
  markets we've identified.""
      Not very long ago Union Carbide had the attitude ""that if
  we couldn't do it ourselves, it wasn't worth doing. Or, if it
  was worth doing, we had to go it alone,"" Lichtenberger
  explained.
      He said ""there are times when exploiting a profitable
  market is done best with a partner. Nor do we see any need to
  plow resources into a technology we may not have if we can link
  up profitably with someone who is already there.""
      He said Carbide has extended its catalyst business that way
  and is now extending its specialty chemicals business in the
  same way.

  Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. said it
  will sign a contract March 17 to buy a half interest in a
  Corpus Christi, Texas refinery and related operations.
      The contract, to be signed by PDVSA and Champlin
  Petroleum's parent company, the Union Pacific Corp, will create
  a new joint venture called Champlin Refining.
      The state oil company said PDVSA will pay on the order of
  30 mln dlrs for the half interest in Champlin.
       Energy minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said Wednesday
  the cost would be 33 mln dlrs in cash, plus an additional 60
  mln in crude and refined oil shipments.
      PDVSA and Union Pacific have sought a line of credit from a
  group of North American and Japanese banks to finance the new
  company's working capital, the Venezuelan company said.
      Under the deal, PDVSA will supply up to 140,000 barrels a
  day to the refinery with the option to place 50,000 bpd more -
  mostly gasoline and distillates - through Champlin's
  distribution system in 10 U.S. states.
      The new company will be directed by a six-member board,
  with three representatives each from PDVSA and Union Pacific.
      According to PDVSA, Venezuelans will occupy such key
  positions such as treasurer and vice-president for
  manufacturing.
      The total capacity of the Champlin refinery is 160,000 bpd
  of crudes and another 40,000 bpd of intermediates. The plant
  will be able to handle 110,000 bpd of Venezuelan heavy crudes,
  which make up more than half of the country's crude oil
  exports.

2597,1,"CITROEN EXPECTS HIGHER PROFITS, HELPED BY AX
  Automobiles Citroen expects rising
  sales of its new AX compact car to help boost profits
  significantly this year, continuing a financial recovery after
  six straight years of losses, president Jacques Calvet said.
      Speaking to reporters during weekend trials for the new AX
  sports model, he said: ""All the budgetary forecasts that we have
  been able to make ... Show a relatively significant improvement
  in 1987, compared with 1986,"" he added.
      Citroen, part of the private Peugeot SA &lt;PEUP.PA> group,
  increased its share of the French new car market to 13.7 pct in
  first two months 1987 from 12.1 pct a year earlier. It is
  aiming for an average 12.8 pct share throughout the year after
  11.7 pct in 1986.
      The firm believes it is on target to raise its share of the
  European market, excluding France, to 3.2 pct this year from
  2.9 pct in 1986.
      ""Our first problem is to produce enough vehicles to meet the
  demand,"" Calvet said. ""This is a relatively new problem for us.""
      Citroen lost close to two billion francs in 1984 but cut
  the deficit to 400 mln in 1985, helped by moves to modernise
  its range and improve productivity.
      Calvet indicated last December he expected Citroen's 1986
  profit to be between 250 and 500 million francs.
      This weekend he said that those profit estimates ""remain
  about the same -- perhaps even a little more optimistic.""
      Some of this optimism is due to the early success of the
  AX, launched on the French market last October. It will be
  available throughout most of western Europe within four months.
      The car has registered just over 20,000 sales.
      It is being built at Citroen's large plant at Aulnay-sous-
  Bois in northern Paris, as well as at Rennes in Brittany and
  Vigo in Spain, with production just reaching target level of
  1,000 cars a day.
      The car, which Citroen markets as an intermediate model
  between its long-running 2CV and the Visa, is designed to
  compete with the Renault 5, Volkswagen Polo and Opel Corsa.
      The AX had built up its market share in France to around
  four pct last month. Calvet said: ""Our hope is that once the AX
  is fully developed, we will have between 6.5 and seven per cent
  of the national market.""

      The alternatives include continuation of the company's

  Pearson Plc &lt;PSON.L> said the recent
  sale of its Fairey Engineering companies, in a 51.5 mln stg
  management buy-out, was part of its policy of concentrating on
  four key sectors.
      In a statement with its 1986 results, the company said its
  information and entertainments sector's Financial Times, FT,
  newspaper had record sales and profits.
      The FT is subject to a 70 mln stg investment programme,

  plant in the London docklands next year.
      Its other key sectors are merchant banking, oil and china.
      Commenting on its Camco Inc oil service subsidiary, Pearson
  said it believes the oil business setback is only temporary.
      The group has been acquiring oil properties in both the
  U.S. And Britain which will begin to make a significant impact
  on profits in the 1990s.
      Far East operations of fine china subsidiary Royal Doulton
  Ltd are being expanded in the wake of record recent sales in
  Japan, it added.
      Pearson reported 1986 pre-tax profit of 121.1 mln stg, up

2650,2,"AVIA STOCKHOLDERS SEEK TO BLOCK SALE TO REEBOK
  &lt;Avia Group International Inc> 
  stockholders filed a class a action suit in Multnomah County
  Circuit court seeking to halt the sale of Avia to Reebok
  International Ltd &lt;RBOK>.
      Avia stockholders also seek to receive compensation from
  the defendants, who include most of Avia directors, according
  to court papers.
      The suit grew out a meeting of several dozen dissatisfied
  minority stockholders of Avia following the announcement of
  Reebok's proposed acquisition of Avia and the sudden drop in
  the price of Avia stock.
      The complaint was filed on behalf of Clem Eischen, a
  Portland-area resident, who owns 500 shares of Avia, and Robert
  Withers, also of the Portland-area, who owns 954 shares, and
  other individuals who held stock at the time of Reebok's
  announcement. A jury trial has been requested.
      ""The actions of the small group that contral Avia have hurt
  the little guy,"" said Eischen.
      The stockholders, according to a statement, have organized
  a steering committee.
      The complaint reviews the price action of Avia stock from
  March 1986 and noted the plaintifs who purchased stock between
  19 dlrs and 25 dlrs per share. The price fell from 24 dlrs to
  16.50 dlrs a share following the Reebok announcement.
      The complaint asked the defendants be enjoined from
  proceeding with the Reebok acquisition of Avia. It also
  requests damages to be determined at the time of trial.
      Avia said it had not seen the court papers and said it had
  no comment on the suit.

2655,1,"H AND R BLOCK &lt;HRB> SEES GAINS FROM TAX REFORM
  With the April 15 tax return deadline
  less than a month away, confused taxpayers will be converging
  on H and R Block Inc's offices to interpret the new tax codes.
      Financial results for the nation's largest tax preparer are
  expected to be good in fiscal 1987 but next year could be a
  ""bonanza,"" analysts say.
      ""For the short term the key word is confusion, Block Vice
  President Tom Bloch said in an interview. ""When Congress
  drastically changes laws, confusion results and tax preparers
  benefit,"" Bloch said.
      ""Next year, when taxpayers take the new forms and place
  them side by side to compare them, more people will throw their
  hands up and say 'I'm going to get help,'"" he said.
  ""Tax forms will look very different next year,"" he added.
      Kidder Peabody analyst Herbert Buchbinder expects Block's
  fiscal 1987 year (to end April 30) to show good gains over
  fiscal 1986 earnings of 60.1 mln dlrs or 2.41 dlrs a share on
  revenues of 606.7 mln dlrs. He estimates Block's fiscal 1987
  earnings at 2.75 to 2.80 dlrs.
      ""Next year, Block could have a bonanza,"" Buchbinder said.
  Based on estimates of a larger work force, Block could show a
  gain of more than five pct in tax forms prepared, he said. In
  the 1986 tax season, Block prepared 9,215,300 U.S. tax returns,
  up 1.5 pct over the previous year.
      The Internal Revenue Service estimates about 100 mln
  individual income tax returns will be filed for the 1987 tax
  season, up from last year's 94 mln forms. Professional tax
  preparers accounted for just over 43 million forms, according
  to the IRS.
      For the longer term, while confusion will continue to bring
  clients into Block's 8,866 tax preparation offices worldwide,
  there are some changes in the act that will have a negative
  effect, Bloch conceded.
      Certain changes in filing requirements will shorten the tax
  return, and in some cases, simplify the form, he noted. In
  addition, some low income wage earners will be taken off the
  tax rolls, he said.
      Block is currently analyzing its price structure to try to
  offset some of the negatives. Last tax season, the average cost
  for each return in the U.S. amounted to 48.05 dlrs and 45.73
  dlrs worldwide, Bloch said. This tax season, rates will be up
  about three or four pct, in line with the inflation rate, he
  said.
      Block expects ""some expansion"" this tax season of its
  electronic filing system which directly feeds into the IRS and
  can speed up the refund process. Block can choose where and by
  how much it wants to expand into the seven cities made
  available for the direct filing by the IRS, Bloch noted.
      The IRS estimates about 90,000 returns will be directly
  filed this tax season, up from the 26,000 returns injected in
  the 1986 tax season.
      First Kansas City analyst Jonathan Braatz said that Block
  will benefit greatly from lower tax rates in fiscal 1988.
      Braatz expects Block's advertising budget to be about the
  same as last year which will be helped a bit by lower costs for
  television ads. ""They may get a little more bang for their
  buck,"" he said.
      He estimates Block has about 150 mln dlrs cash on its
  balance sheet sheet, and says if interest rates rise it could
  be of great benefit to them.

  Endotronics Inc said it expects to
  incur ""substantial losses"" for the second quarter ending March
  31 and fiscal year ending Sept 30, 1987.
      As one factor behind the anticipated loss, Endotronics
  cited a dispute by one of its Japanese distributors, &lt;Yamaha
  Inc>, over payment of a 3,686,000 dlr promissory note.
      In a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange
  Commission, Endotronics said the note was for overdue accounts
  receivable from sales of instruments to Yamaha and another
  Japanese distributor during the company's 1986 fiscal year.
      Endotronics said at its present reduced level of operations
  it will exhaust all currently available cash and credit
  facilities in early May 1987. It said this assumes full use of
  the remaining 1,250,000 dlrs available under a line of credit
  from Celanese Corp, which requires approval of Celanese Corp
  &lt;CZ>.
      The company said its ability to obtain funding was
  adversely affected by a suit filed March 4 by two of its
  shareholders seeking to represent a class of holders against
  three officers of Endotronics.
      Endotronics said the complaint against it alleges
  violations of the federal securities laws in connection with
  statements made in the company's annual and quarterly reports.
      The company also said the Securities Division of the
  Minnesota Department of Commerce is conducting an inquiry into
  the company's Japanese sales for fiscal 1986 and trading by
  insiders and brokers in the company's common shares.
      It said similar inquiries are being conducted by the
  Securities and Exchange Commission. The investigations will
  hurt the company's ability to obtain funding, it said.
      As a result of the dispute over payment of the promissory
  note, the law suit challenging its financial data and the
  various investigations concerning insider trading, the company
  said it no longer expects that anticipated declines in
  instrument sales in Japan in fiscal 1987 will be offset by
  increased instrument sales in other foreign countries and the
  United States.

2717,1,"ROYAL TRUST PLOTS AGGRESSIVE GLOBAL EXPANSION
  &lt;Royal Trustco Ltd>, in a move unique
  among Canadian trust companies, is pursuing a bold global
  expansion that could someday lift the foreign share of its
  yearly earnings to 50 pct, president Michael Cornelissen said.
      First Marathon Securities Ltd financial services analyst
  Michael Walsh said Royal Trust's international growth target is
  attainable. But it ""will be a tremendous achievement because
  ... they're going to have to build an international earnings
  base larger than the earnings of a lot of significant domestic
  trust companies,"" Walsh said.
      Global operations, which made up 22 pct of Royal Trust's
  154 mln dlr 1986 net profit, will post 33 pct profit growth
  this year against an expected 15 pct jump in total company
  profit, Cornelissen told Reuters in an interview.
      He said the foreign share of total profit would rise to 26
  pct in 1987 and to 44 pct by 1990.
      Royal Trust, Canada's second largest trust company with
  assets of about 19.54 billion Canadian dlrs, has operated
  internationally since 1929 when it opened a London bank.
      Its aggressive global strategy began in the 1980s, when
  other Canadian trusts, the equivalent of U.S. savings and
  loans, were focusing on domestic retail banking.
      The company's overseas ambitions were whetted by heightened
  domestic competition and impressive growth at its London bank
  operations, which attained full British banking powers in 1980,
  Cornelissen said.
      Last year, Royal Trust moved into continental Europe and
  Asia with its 239 mln Canadian dlr acquisition of Dow Chemical
  Co &lt;DOW>'s Dow Financial Services Corp, which included asset
  management, merchant and private banking companies.
      ""It was a heaven-sent opportunity,"" Cornelissen said of the
  Dow Financial acquisition. ""We achieved in one year what would
  otherwise have taken five to 10 years to set up.""
      Cornelissen stressed that Royal Trust would shun direct
  competition with major global financial institutions in
  activities such as international lending and stock brokerage,
  in order to exploit ""profitable niches"" overseas in traditional
  trust activities such as asset management, private banking and
  advisory services.
      He said that Royal Trust hoped to complete negotiations
  ""before the end of this month"" to sell its London-based Savory
  Milln brokerage, acquired in the Dow Financial deal.
      ""The international market is so big and we have such a
  miniscule share of it that growth opportunities are really
  limited only by our energy and our desire to find more
  business,"" he said, adding that in trust-type services, ""we
  don't think the international markets are well-served.""
      Aiding Royal Trust's foreign growth are greater foreign 
  investment interest in North America and increased Canadian
  investment abroad, Cornelissen said.
      Central to Royal Trust's strategy is Asia, boasting rapid
  economic growth and huge pools of Japanese capital, said
  Cornelissen, whose company administers assets of 71.85 billion
  dlrs, more than any other Canadian trust.
      Citing statistics indicating that by the year 2000, Asia
  will contain two-thirds of the world's population and 50 pct of
  global productive capacity, Cornelissen said, ""We knew we had
  to be there."" Royal Trust's 14 international locations include
  offices in Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. The company also
  recently listed its shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
      The Royal Trust president said the company was stressing
  growth within its overseas units, adding he did not foresee any
  acquisitions in the ""immediate future,"" although ""we have our
  eyes wide open for the right opportunities.""
      Asked about Royal Trust's plans for the U.S., which the
  company abandoned with the 1983 sale of its Florida bank units,
  Cornelissen said the company faced a trust services market well
  covered by hundreds of small regional banks.
      ""That doesn't mean to say we shouldn't be in the U.S.,""
  said Cornelissen. ""That is probably one area that we will
  probably do something with in the next five years.""
      He said the company would continue to emphasize its home
  Canadian market, which Cornelissen and financial services
  analysts agreed would remain vital to Royal Trust.
      Proposed government regulations to allow Canadian banks,
  trusts, insurance and securities dealers full participation in
  one another's actitivies will mean more domestic competition
  for Royal Trust, ""but not drastically more,"" Cornelissen said.

2718,1,"SALOMON RAISES CATERPILLAR &lt;CAT> OPINION
  Salomon Brothers Inc said it raised
  its opinion on Caterpillar Inc's stock to an aggressive buy
  from a hold because of a brighter earnings outlook for 1988.
      Salomon analyst David Sutliff said in a statement he sees
  1988 earnings of 3.35 dlrs a share, up from an earlier forecast
  of three dlrs for the year. The outlook for 1987 remains at
  2.50 dlrs to three dlrs.
      Caterpillar's stock was down 1/2 points at 46-1/4.
      ""Although earnings will be poor for the next two quarters,
  we believe that profits could begin to improve in the second
  half - perhaps significantly - and should surge sharply through
  1988 and 1989,"" he said.
      Sutliff said improved results should come from four factors
  - higher prices, improved market share, reduced costs, and
  improved demand.
      The higher prices will stick because its Japanese
  competitor, Komatsu, has had to raise prices because of the
  increased value of the yen, he said.

      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,

  shares, for 81.1 mln dlrs as an investment.
      But the group, acting through Clevebaco L.P., a Cleveland

      The Lerner group said it filed with the Federal Reserve

  of the common stock of AmeriTrust, a Cleveland bank holding
  company.
      If the Fed approves, Lerner, whose Equitable Bancorp is

  stock, subject to market conditions and other factors.
      Since Lerner heads a bank holding company with assets

2799,2,"SCHLUMBERGER &lt;SLB> ENDS PACT TO SELL FAIRCHILD
  Schlumberger Ltd said it terminated an
  agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd to buy 80 pct of its
  Fairchild Semiconductor operations.
      The company said the rising political controversy in the
  U.S. concerning the venture made it unlikely that the sale of
  the Fairchild stake could be completed within a reasonable
  time.
      The sale has been opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department
  and the U.S. Defense Department, in part on national security
  grounds.
      The company said termination of the agreement opened other
  possibilities, including a possible leveraged buyout of the
  semiconductor maker by Fairchild management.
      In the interim, Fairchild would continue its ongoing
  business within Schlumberger, the oilfield services concern
  said.
      Last October, Schlumberger announced the sale of the
  Fairchild stake and said it would take a 200 mln dlrs charge in
  the fourth quarter from the sale. The company ended up
  recording special charges of 2.1 billion dlrs in the fourth
  quarter, leading to a loss of 2.02 billion dlrs for the year.
      Schlumberger never announced a price for the sale, but
  industry analysts have estimated the value of the deal at about
  200 mln dlrs.
      The proposed sale was under antitrust review by the U.S.
  Justice Department. Additionally, Commerce Secretary Malcolm
  Baldridge and other U.S. officials have voiced reservations
  about the transaction since it was announced.
      Government officials have expressed concern that the sale
  could reduce the competitiveness of U.S. chip makers by putting
  key advanced technology into Japanese hands.
      New, high-technology semiconductors are used in
  supercomputers, which are faster and more powerful than
  existing computers.
      Schlumberger is an oilfield services company controlled by
  French interests and headquartered in New York. Fujitsu Ltd is

2829,2,"SCHLUMBERGER &lt;SLB> MAY HAVE ALTERNATE BUYER
  Schlumberger Ltd most likely has an
  alternate buyer lined up for its Fairchild Semiconductor unit,
  Wall Street analysts said.
      ""I think its clear that in cancelling its agreement with
  Fujitsu, Schlumberger has signaled that it has another deal in
  the works,"" said Paul Johnson, a semiconductor analyst with
  L.F. Rothschild.
      ""There are unquestionably other buyers out there,"" added
  Kidder Peabody analyst Adam F. Cuhney. ""A lot of companies have
  looked at Fairchild and would be willing to buy it.""
      Among the companies that would be interested in bidding for
  Fairchild are Advanced Micro Devices &lt;AMD>, Sunnyvale, Calif.,
  and LSI Logic Corp &lt;LLSI>, Milpitas, Calif., industry analysts
  said.
      Top U.S. chipmakers like National Semiconductor Corp &lt;NSM>,
  Texas Instruments Inc &lt;TXN> and Motorola Inc &lt;MOT> might also
  seek to buy Fairchild, but could possibly run into antitrust
  problems, the analysts added.
      Moreover, Fairchild's management is thought to be
  considering proposing a leveraged buyout of the Cupertino,
  Calif., company, analysts said.
      In a brief statement announcing the termination of the
  agreement with Fujitsu, Schlumberger said the decision opened
  up other possibilities, including a possible buyout by
  Fairchild management.
      The company said it ended the deal, in which Fujitsu would
  have bought 80 pct of Fairchild for an estimated 200 mln dlrs,
  because rising opposition to the deal by the Reagan
  administration made it unlikely that the sale could be
  completed within a reasonable period of time.
      Analysts questioned this explanation, however, arguing that
  the companies did not need government approval to complete the
  transaction. Both Schlumberger and Fujitsu are foreigned-owned
  companies.
      ""Schlumberger would not have terminated the deal because
  the U.S. government didn't want it,"" said Johnson of L.F.
  Rothschild.
      A spokesman for Schlumberger declined to elaborate on the
  company's news release.
      He said only that the company was reviewing a number of
  possible alternatives for the Fairchild unit.
      Officials at Fairchild and Fujitsu were not immediately
  available for comment.
      Analysts noted the significance of the government's
  apparent success in preventing Fujitsu from taking control of
  Fairchild.
      Administration officials, including Commerce Secretary
  Malcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger,
  feared that the sale to Fujitsu would lead to Japanese control
  of key semiconductor technology for supercomputers and military
  weapons systems.
      ""The government really stood up for the semiconductor
  industry,"" said Johnson of L.F. Rothschild. ""That, I think, is
  the real significance of this.""
      Consequently, analysts said, the Japanese government might
  now feel more pressure to address U.S. complaints about
  Japanese chipmakers' violation of the semiconductor trade
  agreement signed last summer.

"
2835,2,"ICAHN SAYS HE IS TARGET OF SEC INVESTIGATION
  Corporate raider Carl Icahn
  acknowledged that he is one of the targets of an investigation
  by the Securities and Exchange Commission into possible
  violations of securities laws.
      Icahn, who heads and controls Trans World Airlines Inc
  &lt;TWA>, made the acknowledgement in a filing TWA was required to
  make with the SEC disclosing its 14.8 pct stake in USAir Group.
      The SEC issued a formal order launching the private
  investigation on Nov 12, 1986, Icahn said in the SEC filing.
      The order empowers SEC investigators to try to find out
  whether any persons, including Icahn, violated securities laws
  and related rules, Icahn said.
      Specifically, the probe is examining the acquisition and
  subsequent sale of more than five pct of the stock of certain
  unspecified companies, he said.
      Federal law requires individuals or groups of individuals
  who have made shareholder agreements, to disclose stakes in
  companies of at least five pct within 10 days.
      Icahn has acknowledged that he has been subpoenaed in
  connection with SEC probes, but this is the first time he has
  disclosed that he is among those being investigated.
      By making the disclosure in a filing with the SEC, which is
  obviously already aware of its own probe, Icahn was also
  alerting current and potential shareholders of TWA.
      It is not uncommon for companies which are aware that they
  or their officers are the targets of government probes to
  acknowledge the existence of the otherwise secret
  investigations to fulfill their legal disclosure requirements
  to their shareholders.
      Icahn said the SEC is looking into whether he and others
  whom he did not name violated securities laws by acquiring and
  selling more than five pct of a company's stock.
      SEC investigations into those kinds of possible securities
  law violations have been spawned by the agency's widening probe
  into the Wall Street insider trading scandal, according to
  published reports.
      Making late filings of 13D forms, which disclose the amount
  of stock over five pct an investor has in a company, or making
  no filing at all could indicate a scheme to ""warehouse"" shares
  of stock.
      In a warehousing scheme, a group of investors acting in
  concert would each amass stock in the company without
  disclosing that they have an agreement among them.
      By failing to disclose that they are acting together the
  market is unware of the amount of stock of a company that is
  controlled by a group acting in concert.
      Last year, the SEC charged members of the wealthy Belzberg
  family of Canada with taking part in a warehousing scheme while
  it was accumulating stock in Ashland Oil Inc.

2836,1,"SMITHKLINE &lt;SKB> AIMS FOR 10 PCT EARNINGS RAISE
  SmithKline Beckman Corp said it is
  pursuing a three-point stragey that will achieve a 10 pct
  annual increase in operating earnings throughout the remainder
  of the decade.
      In 1986, SmithKline earned 521.1 mln dlrs or 6.78 dlrs per
  share on revenues of 3.6 billion dlrs.
      The company said in its annual report that its
  nonpharmaceutical business will play a major role in meeting
  its earnings growth target, and will in fact grow faster than
  its pharmaceutical business.
      SmithKline, whose major product is the antiulcer medication
  Tagamet, said in the report that it intends to improve earnings
  from existing products, expand its product portfolio and
  optimize its financial resources.
      To bolster its position in the antiulcer market, in which
  Tagamet has met stiff competition, SmithKline said its strategy
  to develop an over-the-counter version of Tagamet is bolstered
  by two joint ventures, one with &lt;Wellcome PLC>, and one pending
  venture in Japan.
      SmithKline also said its Allergan Inc eye and skin care
  products division can be a one billion dlr organization in the
  next five years that can grow at more than seven to 10 pct
  annually.
      ""Nondilutive acquisitions are a real possibility,"" Gavin
  Herbert, president of the eye and skin care product group said
  in the report. In 1986, Allergan had worldwide sales of 433 mln
  dlrs.
      It said its Smith Kline and French Laboratories
  pharmaceuticals unit, with 1986 sales of 1.9 billion dlrs, will
  file for Food and Drug Administration marketing approval for a
  number of cardiovascular agents, including tissue plasminogen
  activator, over the next two years.
      It also said SK and F's U.S. sales force will be 20 pct
  larger in 1987, with more than 1,000 sales personnel.
      Smith Kline also said its small clinical laboratory testing
  unit, with 1986 sales of 373 mln dlrs, performs 24 mln tests a
  year, and sees increases in employee drug testing as well as in
  testing for the AIDS antibody.
      Smith Kline said that depending on its share price and the
  cost of money, it may buy back more shares. In the last three
  years, it has bought back about 25 pct of its shares.
      SmithKline begins the year with a new management team,
  including its new chief operating officer George Ebright.

  net gain in the quarter from excess pension funds used to pay
  down debt. ""However, it is difficult to determine now whether
  this gain will be sufficient to offset the expected operating
  loss,"" the company said in a statement. A company spokesman
  would not elaborate.
      The company's Ashland Petroleum Co unit operated at a loss

  prices enough to recover higher crude oil costs, Ashland said.
      Although Ashland Petroleum and SuperAmerica, a retail
  marketing operation, are having a difficult quarter, the
  company's Valvoline, Ashland Chemical and coal businesses are
  expected to report good results for the quarter ended March 31.

  A U.S. Commerce Department spokesman
  said the agency would have no comment on Schlumberger Ltd's
  announcement that it had terminated an agreement in principle
  to sell its Fairchild Semiconductor Corp unit to Fujitsu Ltd.
      Sclumberger had said that controversy surrounding the
  venture made it unlikely the sale could be completed any time
  soon. The sale was opposed by Commerce and the U.S. Defense
  Department, in part on national security grounds.
      Commerce chief spokesman B.J. Cooper said the department
  had had no contact with Schlumberger about the deal.
      A Defense Department spokesman said the agency was unaware
  of Schlumberger's announcement and would have no immediate
  reaction.
      Officials last week told Reuters that Commerce Secretary
  Malcolm Baldrige and Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger had
  joined forces to fight the planned sale because it could have
  left the U.S. military overly dependent on foreign sources for
  vital equipment used in high-technology weapons.

2848,1,"ROYAL BANK/CANADA BRAZIL UNIT SEES GROWTH
  Royal Bank of Canada's &lt;RY> small
  Brazilian commercial bank subsidiary Banco Royal do Canada
  (Brasil) S.A. sees opportunities for its own growth with an
  expected substantial increase in Brazilian exports to Canada,
  Banco Royal president Michael Brennan said.
      ""They (Brazilian exporters) are very interested in the
  Canadian market because it's an untapped market,"" Brennan told
  reporters after a speech to the Brazil/Canada Chamber of
  Commerce.
      Brennan said Brazil is currently exporting products like
  paper machinery and ships to Canada.
      He said he hopes to see medium-term financing facilities
  for Brazilian companies reinstated shortly, following an
  agreement reached in January with international financial
  authorities.
      Brennan estimated Brazilian exports to Canada totalled
  roughly 800 mln Canadian dlrs in 1985 while imports from Canada
  reached about 700 mln dlrs.
      Brennan said he expects Banco Royal profit to increase this
  year from the three mln U.S. dlrs reported for fiscal 1986
  ended September 30 but said he could not predict by how much
  because of the country's uncertain financial climate.
      Brennan said he expects his bank's growth to come from
  increased exports to Canada. Banco Royal is the only
  Canadian-owned commercial bank in Brazil although &lt;Bank of
  Montreal> has a Brazilian investment bank subsidiary, he said.
      Brennan said he expected Brazil to be able to reach an
  equitable agreement with foreign banks on restructuring its 68
  billion U.S. dlr foreign debt, because the Brazilian economy is
  essentially healthy. He said he believed Brazil might be in a
  position to resume debt repayments within a year.
      Brennan said he could not comment on the impact of Brazil's
  interest payment moratorium on the Royal Bank of Canada.

  its chairman, Oscar S. Wyatt Jr, unlawfully interfered with
  agreements it previously reached with its creditors, causing
  the company significant damage.
      TransAmerica also said its suit, filed in state district

      Coastal has used TransAmerica's bankruptcy proceedings to
  engineer a hostile takeover attempt, the company charged.

2871,1,"CATHAY PACIFIC 1986 PROFIT SEEN ABOVE TARGET
  Buoyed by low fuel prices and
  favourable currency factors, Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd's
  &lt;CAPH.HK> 1986 profits are expected to surpass the airline's
  forecast of one billion H.K. Dlrs, stock analysts said.
      Analysts said they expect the airline to show net earnings
  of between 1.1 billion and 1.25 billion dlrs when it reports
  results tomorrow for its first year as a public company.
      Cathay, 51 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HK>, made
  its earnings forecast in the prospectus for its flotation in
  May last year.
      Cathay is expected to pay a 13-cent final dividend, making
  a total of 19 cents for the year, as forecast in the
  prospectus, analysts polled by Reuters said.
      They said the airline's performance improved in the second
  half of the year after it reported interim profits of 503 mln
  dlrs.
      The weakness of the local currency, pegged at 7.80 to one
  U.S. Dollar, and low fuel prices moved further in the company's
  favour from the assumptions made in the prospectus at the time
  of the flotation, James Capel (Far East) Ltd said.
      James Capel estimates average fuel prices for the airline
  industry in 1986 at 63 U.S. Cents per gallon, 27 pct below the
  1985 level. It said a one pct movement in fuel prices would
  affect Cathay's net profits by 10 mln dlrs and forecast profits
  of 1.25 billion dlrs.
       Analysts said the company's estimates of fuel price and
  currency movements set out in its prospectus were conservative.
      ""This is reflected in their interim results which showed
  that profit margin has increased,"" said Frederick Tsang of
  Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd.
      Cathay's six-month turnover rose 19.8 pct from year-earlier
  levels, but profits rose 69 pct.
      The rise in oil prices in late 1986 had little impact on
  the company's fuel oil bill last year, as aviation fuel prices
  usually lag behind crude price movements by several months,
  analysts said.
      By last September the yen had risen some 54 pct against the
  Hong Kong dollar from the end of 1985, the mark 43 pct and
  sterling 12 pct.
      ""Overall the weakness of the Hong Kong dollar against
  Cathay's major trading currencies helped push passenger yields
  in the first half up 7.2 pct,"" said James Capel. ""This should
  continue through the second half to enable passenger yields to
  end the year up 7.6 pct.""
      A strong performance from the 2.9 billion dlrs in cash
  under management also improved profits, James Capel said.
      A general improvement in air traffic last year contributed
  to Cathay's revenue increase, but the company's load factor
  declined because of increased competition and an expansion of
  its fleet and services.
      James Capel estimated Cathay's passenger-kilometres flown
  last year rose six pct from 1985 and freight-kilometres flown
  climbed 17 pct, though the airline's load factor probably fell
  to 68.8 pct from 70 pct.
      ""Cathay added new planes, and was forced to fly some routes
  last year because of the threat of competition from Dragon Air,""
  said Tsang. ""This affected its load factor.""
      Fear of possible competition from fledgling carrier &lt;Hong
  Kong Dragon Airways Ltd> may have contributed to Cathay's
  decision to resume service to New Zealand last year, analysts
  said.

"
2873,2,"FAIRCHILD DEAL FAILURE SEEN MAKING JAPANESE WARY
  Schlumberger Ltd's &lt;SLB.N> decision to
  end an agreement in principle for Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T> to buy
  80 pct of its &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>, and the political
  furore that surrounded the proposed sale, will make Japanese
  companies more cautious in their efforts to acquire U.S. High
  technology firms but will not halt such attempts, industry
  analysts said.
      The collapse of the deal will not be a critical blow to
  Fujitsu but it will boost the cost of future U.S. Expansion by
  the Japanese firm, said analysts polled by Reuters.
      ""The acquisition of Fairchild is not essential to Fujitsu's
  North American operations, but it would have been a great
  boost,"" James Capel and Co analyst Tom Murtha said.
      French-controlled Schlumberger said yesterday it was ending
  the agreement because mounting political controversy in the
  U.S. Made it unlikely that the sale of the Fairchild stake
  could be completed in a reasonable time.
      The sale was opposed by the U.S. Commerce Department and
  Defence Department, partly on national security grounds.
      Fujitsu's acquisition of Fairchild would have given the
  Japanese computer maker control of a comprehensive North
  American sales and distribution system and access to
  microprocessor technology, an area where Fujitsu is weak,
  analysts said.
      The deal would also have given Fujitsu 14 additional
  microchip production facilities worldwide, eight of them in the
  U.S., A report by the Capel firm said.
      ""It was an entry point, a port for semiconductors and a
  marketing channel for other things,"" said Barclays de Zoete Wedd
  analyst Rick May.
      Several analysts said the purchase would not have given
  Fujitsu access to critical defence technology.
      ""(Fairchild) simply doesn't have key technology -- that's a
  thing of the past,"" May said.
      The failure could be a blessing in disguise for Fujitsu as
  it might have had to spend several hundred million dollars to
  modernise Fairchild's production lines, Capel's Murtha said.
      The failure of the deal will doubtless encourage Japanese
  firms to take a lower profile in attempts to acquire U.S. High
  tech firms but they are unlikely to stop, analysts said.
      Most analysts said Fujitsu was likely to go the more costly
  route of expanding its own production and distribution
  facilities in the U.S., Although some said it could use the
  estimated 200 mln dlrs set aside for buying Fairchild to try to
  acquire some less politically symbolic firm.
      ""It may slow the pace of Japanese acquisitions, but the
  necessity of expanding their production and design capacity in
  America remains,"" said Capel's Murtha. ""The Japanese will
  continue to shop for bargains, but it will be harder to find
  ones that are politically acceptable.""
      Japanese firms are likely to favour joint ventures or
  smaller equity stakes in firms to avoid the political backlash
  that blocked the Fairchild sale, analysts said. ""They're not
  going to slow up, they're just going to buy smaller pieces ...
  Because of the political risk,"" said Barclays de Zoete's May.
      Several Japanese firms have already taken 10 to 30 pct
  shares in smaller U.S. High technology firms such as super
  minicomputer makers, he said.
      Opposition of the sort that blocked Fujitsu could end up
  harming U.S. Firms and undermining a trend toward multinational
  tie-ups, some analysts said.
      ""This is not really of benefit to U.S. Firms either,"" said
  Jardine Fleming (Securities) Ltd analyst Nick Edwards. ""The
  pooling of resources in semiconductors is a positive move --
  why should the government step in to prevent it?""
      Japan's Minister of International Trade and Industry Hajime
  Tamura told a press conference that interference by U.S.
  Government officials in the Fairchild deal was inappropriate.
      ""This is entirely a private sector matter and not a matter
  for governments' comment,"" Tamura said. ""I think it was improper
  for U.S. Government officials to intervene to the extent they
  did,"" he said.
      A spokesman told Reuters the ministry's view is that
  international investment flows ought to be free and that such
  flows are of increasing importance in line with the growing
  closeness of U.S.-Japanese economic ties.

  American Telephone and Telegraph Co and

  direct and indirect holdings in France's &lt;Cie Generale de
  Constructions Telephoniques> if a joint bid with French
  partners for the soon-to-be-privatised firm succeeds, a
  director at one of the partner firms said.
      Marc Mathieu of &lt;Societe Anonyme de Telecommunications>
  SAT, told journalists the bid foresaw a direct stake of 20 pct
  for APT, the joint firm set up by the U.S.'s ATT &lt;T.N.> and the
  NV Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken &lt;PGLO.AS>.
      The other 80 pct would be owned by a holding company made
  up of SAT, APT, Cie du Midi &lt;MCDP.PA> and five mutual funds.
     Under French law, foreign investors are restricted to a 20
  pct direct stake in privatised companies but can boost their
  stake to 40 pct through indirect holdings.
      The make-up of the holding company, however, is subject to
  close discussions within the government due to legal queries
  over the nationality of the mutual funds, a Finance Ministry
  official said.
      Although bought by French citizens they are managed by
  foreign banks &lt;Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York> and
  &lt;Banque de Neuflize, Schlumberger, Mallet SA>, controlled by
  Algemene Bank Nederland NV &lt;ABNN.AS>, an SAT spokesman said.
      CGCT, which controls 16 pct of the French public telephone
  switching market, is to be sold by the government for 500 mln
  francs by private tender.
      Five groups are bidding for the company and the government
  has said it will choose CGCT's new owner by the end of April.
      APT vice-president Wim Huisman told a news conference a
  capital increase was envisaged if SAT-APT wins CGCT, but
  declined to give details or say how an increase would affect
  foreign stakes in CGCT.
      In 1985, CGCT posted losses of 200 mln francs on sales of
  three billion after 1984 losses of 997 mln francs.
      A joint SAT-APT statement added that buyers were committed
  to investing 240 mln francs in CGCT research and production
  plants. The APT-SAT offer includes a provision for CGCT to
  produce APT 5ESS-PRX switching technology and adapt it to
  French standards.
      The tender was launched after a 1985 draft agreement for
  ATT to take over CGCT was abandoned following the introduction
  of the French government privatisation laws which reopened
  bidding among a wider range of applicants.
      Other candidacies to take over CGCT include West Germany's

  Coastal Corp said it expected earnings
  for 1987 ""to be significantly above"" profits of 71.6 mln dlrs
  last year.
      In a letter to shareholders appearing in the company's
  newly-issued 1986 annual report, Coastal chairman Oscar Wyatt
  did not elaborate on how much earnings were expected to
  increase.
      The 1986 profits of Coastal, a natural gas production and
  pipeline company, were halved from 1985 levels due to slumping
  energy prices. The company's sales totaled 6.7 billion dlrs
  last year.
      Coastal also said it sold its natural gas for an average
  price of 2.17 dlrs per mcf in 1986, a drop of 18 pct from the
  previous year. Oil and natural gas liquids sold for an average
  14.20 dlrs a barrel in 1986, a reduction of 37 pct.
      The Houston-based company, which produced a daily average
  of 120 mln cubic feet of gas and 11,149 barrels of oil, said it
  had proved reserves at yearend 1986 of 28.6 mln barrels of oil
  and 954 billion cubic feet of natural gas. Average reserve
  replacement costs were 8.28 dlrs per barrel of oil equivalent
  during the past three-year period, representing a little more
  than half of the industry average, the company said.
      Coastal's more than 800 gasoline retail outlets were
  operated profitably during 1986 ""and are expected to continue
  to do so,"" the company said.

2988,2,"TAFT &lt;TFB> STOCK RISES ON PROPOSAL
  Taft Broadcasting Co stock rose almost
  three points today as its vice chairman and an investment group
  proposed to sweeten a takeover offer for the company.
      However, several arbitragers said they would shy away from
  the stock at its current price levels since it is unclear how
  high bidding for the company would go and whether the company
  would agree to a takeover.
      ""There are too many uncertainties,"" said one arbitrager.
      Taft stock rose 2-7/8 to 155-3/4.
      Dudley Taft, Taft vice chairman, and Narragansett Capital
  Inc said they sent a letter to the Taft board, stating they
  were committed to pursuing acquisition of the broadcast company
  and were prepared to negotiate a transaction in excess of 150
  dlrs per share.
      The company responded that the proposal would be submitted
  to the board of directors, but that no decisions have yet been
  made on a sale of the company.
      ""Someone's betting this company will go for 170 (dlrs per
  share),"" said one arbitrager.
      Arbitragers said the stock is a risky buy at current
  levels, unless an offer was accepted in the 170 dlr per share
  range. They said to make an arbitrage investment at this level
  would be chancy since it will take a long time for any
  transaction to be completed because of regulatory approvals
  necessary for the broadcast properites.
      Taft earlier rejected a 145 dlr per share or 1.35 billion
  dlr bid from the investment group. The company said it rejected
  the bid as inadequate based on advice of Goldman, Sachs and Co,
  its financial adviser. It said it would consider alternatives
  such as restructuring.
      Arbitragers speculated a bidding war may erupt for Taft,
  which has two large shareholders in an investment group led by
  Robert Bass and Carl Lindner, chairman of American Financial
  Corp. The Bass group holds 25 pct of Taft and Lindner holds
  16.2 pct. The Taft family, which founded the company almost 50
  years ago, has about 12 pct.
      Lindner last week told the Securities and Exchange
  Commission he may be interested in making a bid for Taft.
      ""I could see if things got really crazy that it might go
  for 175 (dlrs per share),"" said one arbitrager, but he
  speculated it probably would not even be taken over for more
  than a price in the 160s.
      Another speculated that Lindner might bid, but he
  speculated the investor would not really be interested in
  running the company. Lindner was unavailable for comment.
      Dennis McAlpine, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said
  he had speculated the company might be considering a leveraged
  buyout.
      ""Ideally, you'd have to break this thing up to satisfy all
  the interests involved,"" he said, adding the two largest
  shareholders might be interested in pieces of Taft.
      He said the highest takeover price he calculated for the
  company has been about 140 dlrs per share, but that the highest
  estimates on Wall Street have been about 160. He said the
  latter would be based on more optimistic expectations for the
  broadcast industry.

  Midway Airlines Inc, which has

      Holders will get a dividend of one preferred share purchase
  right on each outstanding share of common stock.
      Each right, when exercisable, will entitle the holder to
  purchase one one-hundredth share of Series C Junior
  Participating preferred stock for 50 dlrs.
      The rights are intended to assure that all holders receive
  fair treatment in the event of a takeover. The company said
  this is not in response to a known effort to acquire control.
      The rights will be exercisable 10 days after a person or
  group buys 20 pct of the company's common, or announces or
  commences a tender offer that would result in acquisition of 30
  pct or more of its common.
      Midway can redeem the rights at two cts each at any time
  prior to expieration of 10 days after the acquisition by any
  person of 20 pct or more of the companyt's common, it said.
      If Midway is acquired, each right will entitle its hodler
  to purchase a number of the acquiring company's common shares
  having a market value at that time of twice the right's
  exercise price.
      The dividend will be payable to holders of record April

3002,1,"REYNOLD METALS &lt;RLM> UP ON FURMAN SELZ REPORT
  Shares of Reynolds Metals Co rose
  sharply after Wall Street firm Furman Selz Mager Dietz and
  Birney issued a report focusing on the strong earnings
  potential from the company's Australian gold holding, traders
  familiar with the report said.
      Traders said the report notes that earnings from Australian
  gold holdings could be worth about 35 cts to 55 cts a share
  this year and 1.40 dlrs to two dlrs a share in 1988.
      Reynolds Metals rose three points to 59-5/8 on volume of
  729,500 shares.
      Reynolds owns stakes in the Mount Gibson gold project and
  the Boddington gold project, both located in Australia. An
  analyst familiar with the two mines said ""the properties,
  together, have a potential value of 20 dlrs to 40 dlrs a share
  for Reynolds.""
      The analyst, who asked not to be identified, said the rise
  in the stock today was likely the result of ""U.S. investors
  that were not completely cognizant of the size or the
  importance of the (Reynolds') holdings in Australia.""
      Traders said the Furman Selz report indicates that gold was
  discovered mixed with bauxite in the Boddington mine.
  Boddington is principally a bauxite mine.
      The traders said the report goes on to say that the profits
  from the Boddington gold with substantially reduce the
  production costs of the other metals mined at Boddington.
      Traders said Furman Selz also boosted its earnings
  estimates, expecting Reynolds Metals to earn 4.10 dlr a share
  in 1987 and eight dlrs a share in 1988.
      Last year, Reynolds reported net earnings of 8.18 dlrs a
  share, which included 3.09 dlrs a share for adoption of new
  accounting rules, 1.01 dlrs a share for tax loss carryforwards
  and other extraordinary items.

  H.J. Heinz Co is ""within sight of our
  22nd consecutive year of new records in financial growth"" for
  the fiscal year ending April 30, Chairman and Chief Executive
  Officer Anthony O'Reilly told investment analysts.
      O'Reilly, who declined to make a specific projection, said
  the food company is ""stronger than at any time in its 118-year
  history.""
      Last week Heinz reported third-quarter earnings rose to 55
  cts a share from 46 cts a share. Sales rose to 1.08 billion
  dlrs from 1.01 billion dlrs a year earlier.
      O'Reilly said Heinz will concentrate on backing its big
  brands, new products and services, new geography, internal
  growth and acquisitions.
      He said Heinz Ketchup has its highest market share in
  history, 55 pct. But in response to a question, the executive
  said a volume falloff in the overall product category ""is a
  concern to us.""
      O'Reilly said Weight Watchers continues to perform well and
  will generate revenue in fiscal 1987 of approximately 940 mln
  dlrs.
      O'Reilly told analysts Heinz is in active negotiations to
  build a second plant in China, where it entered a joint venture
  with the government in 1984, forming Heinz-UFE Ltd, which
  produces dry baby food cereal.
      He said Heinz-Japan is ""making a profit and generating its
  first substantial dividends,"" and implementation of a new
  partnership, Seoul-Heinz Ltd, is moving ahead with a new
  manufacturing plant targeted for completion by June in Seoul,
  South Korea.
      To increase its competitiveness, O'Reilly said Heinz
  implemented a ""lowest cost imaginable"" program targeted at
  manufacturing, sales and marketing and procurement.
      He said a modernization program is in effect at the
  company's United Kingdom operations, where the labor force,
  trimmed to 4,000 from 10,000, is expected to be further reduced
  to 2,500 in 1988.

3010,2,"ALLEGHENY BEVERAGE &lt;ABEV> EXPLORES UNIT SALE
  Allegheny Beverage Corp said it
  has been approached by a group interested in acquiring its
  foodservice unit, Service America Corp.
      The group includes senior management of Service America but
  no officers of Allegheny Beverage, the company said.
      The company has agreed to permit the group and its
  potential lenders to perform a due diligence review of Service
  America, it said.
      Allegheny noted it had previously cancelled plans to spin
  off the foodservice subsidiary.
      The company said the group's review is preliminary and
  there is no assurance that an acquisition proposal will be made
  or, if made, accepted.
      Service America had fiscal 1986 revenues of about 934 mln
  dlrs, or about 83 pct of Allegheny Beverage's total revenues of
  1.13 billion dlrs for the year ended March 29, 1986, a
  spokesman for Allegheny Beverage said.
      He declined to identify the Service America officials in
  the acquisition group.
      On Feb 18, 1987, Allegheny said it was cancelling the spin
  off of Service America, but gave no reason for doing so. It
  said it would place major emphasis on managing Service America
  to improve operations and increase earnings at the unit.
      Service America, which Allegheny acquired in May 1985,
  operates cafeterias and food and beverage vending machines.
  Through other subsidiaries, Allegheny provides coin-operated
  laundry services, building maintenance services and retail
  office and furniture operations.
      In fiscal 1986, Allegheny reported earnings from continuing
  operations of 8.2 mln dlrs or 1.09 dlrs a fully diluted share,
  excluding income of 59.7 mln dlrs from discontinued operations
  and an extraordinary loss of 8.1 mln dlrs. In May 1985,
  Allegheny sold its Pepsi-Cola Bottling Co unit to Pepsico Inc
  &lt;PEP> for 160 mln dlrs.
      Including discontinued operations and the special item, net
  income was 59.8 mln dlrs or 6.21 dlrs a share fully diluted.

3014,2,"PERU TO SELL 40 STATE FIRMS TO CUT BUDGET DEFICIT
  peru will sell about 40 state-owned firms
  to trim a projected 740 mln dlrs loss this year among
  government-owned companies.
      Some companies would be sold in their entirety and others
  would be privatised only partially, according to jose palomino,
  president of the government's state company holding firm, the
  national development council (conade).
       He told reporters in a radio interview that the aim was to
  slim a projected public sector firm deficit of 11 billion
  intis. He did not say if foreigners would be allowed to buy all
  or part of the companies.
      Independent economists warn that the deficit could push
  inflation to between 60 and 100 pct in 1987, against the
  govenment target of 40-50 pct.
      Palomino said aeroperu, the government flagship airline
  with a 10-jet fleet, would issue stock for purchase by private
  investors. The company in 1986 registered its first profit in
  eight years, earning about 44.6 mln intis in pre-tax profits.
      Peru has about 140 non-financial state firms. Palomino said
  the government would soon publish a list of those to be sold,
  including those whose shares would be offered on the lima stock
  exchange.
      Last november, palomino said conade's plans included the
  possible sale of a company producing palm oil and another
  manufacturing electrical appliances. Shares could also be sold
  in a copper mine, empresa nacional tintaya sa, in the southern
  state of  arequipa.
      Neither Palomino nor conade's general manager, enrique
  estremadoyro, were available for comment on whether foreigners
  would be allowed to purchase the companies. Their secretaries
  said they were out of their offices.
      Jose antonio almenara, the general manager of the lima
  stock exchange, where shares of the state-owned firms could be
  sold, told reuters that the only foreigners who could purchase
  stock at the exchange had to be tax-paying residents of peru.
      He said foreign stockholders cannot remit profits abroad
  until at least july 1988.

  said. An additional pretax gain of 19 mln dlrs will be deferred
  until realization is more fully assured, it said.
      The diversified chemical and industrial company said the
  sale completes its program to divest retail operations.
      In addition to the cash payment, Grace received warrants to
  buy up to 47.5 pct of the new company and has reinvested about
  19 pct of the proceeds in debt of the new firm.
      Financing was provided by Prudential Insurance Co of

3062,2,"PAPER SAYS U.S. MAY SEEK TO CURB FOREIGN TAKEOVERS
  The Reagan administration will
  consider curbing foreign takeovers of security-sensitive
  industries such as semiconductors and computers, the New York
  Times said, quoting an unnamed senior administration official.
      ""I think there's a strong sentiment here that some
  industries are not totally up for grabs,"" the paper quoted the
  official as saying.
      ""Two of the most visible (industries) are semiconductor and
  computer companies,"" said the official, who the newspaper said
  was a central figure in the opposition to Japan's Fujitsu Ltd
  &lt;ITSU.T> takeover bid for &lt;Fairchild Semiconductor Corp>.
      The Fairchild-Fujitsu deal was abandoned on Monday, and
  industry analysts said the move was a victory for the Reagan
  administration in its drive to beat back Japanese competition
  in the important computer chip manufacturing industry.
      Officials told Reuters last week that Commerce Secretary
  Malcolm Baldrige and Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger fought
  the planned sale of Fairchild by French-controlled Schlumberger
  Ltd &lt;SLB> to Japan's largest computer maker because it could
  have left the U.S. Military dependent on foreign sources for
  vital technology.
      The New York Times quoted Baldrige as saying the time had
  come to limit takeovers in security-sensitive areas.
      ""Everybody wants an open investment policy, but there have
  to be some exceptions for the national interest,"" Baldrige was
  quoted as saying.
      The newspaper said Baldrige and Weinberger are expected to
  bring the takeover issue before a top-level interagency
  policymaking group, such as Treasury Secretary James Baker's
  Economic Policy Council or the president's National Security
  Council.

3063,2,"PHILIPPINES SOCIAL SECURITY TO BUY SAN MIGUEL SHRS
  The Philippines' Social Security System
  (SSS) is planning to buy eight mln shares in diversified brewer
  &lt;San Miguel Corp> (SMC), SMC chief financial officer Ramon del
  Rosario said.
      He told reporters the government organisation had expressed
  interest in one seat on SMC's 15-man board and was preparing to
  invest 800 mln pesos, assuming a purchase price of 100 pesos a
  share.
      The shares involved in the proposal were part of the block
  of 38 mln shares owned by the United Coconut Planters Bank
  (UCPB) and sequestered by the government.
      The block is split between class A and class B stock.
      SMC also proposed to sell a further five mln shares to A.N.
  Soriano Corp, the family company of San Miguel president Andres
  Soriano, del Rosario said.
      The shares are worth some 500 mln pesos at recent prices.
      Del Rosario said the 14 mln B shares in the block which are
  open to foreign ownership would probably be sold to
  unidentified foreign purchasers.
      He said SMC and UCPB would meet later this week to try to
  resolve disputes over the pricing of the shares.
      President Corazon Aquino earlier this month established an
  arbitration panel to settle a row over the disposal of the
  shares.
      Their initial sale to Soriano through SMC Hong Kong unit
  Neptunia Corp was blocked by the Presidential Commission on
  Good Government.
      The commission sequestered the stock on suspicion that the
  real owner of the block was Eduardo Cojuanco, the former
  chairman of San Miguel and the UCPB and a close associate of
  deposed former president Ferdinand Marcos.

3065,2,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN BUYING OVERSEAS FIRMS
  More U.S. And European firms will be
  falling prey to Japanese corporations bulging with cash and
  eager to extend their reach further overseas, according to
  merger and acquisitions specialists polled by Reuters.
      Already, rich Japanese companies have pounced on U.S.
  Banks, steel and other businesses.
      In the latest attempt, Fujitsu Ltd &lt;ITSU.T> -- Japan's
  biggest computer maker -- unsuccessfully bid for &lt;Fairchild
  Semiconductor Corp>, a U.S. Microchip maker which supplies
  components for supercomputers.
      Nomura Securities Co Ltd &lt;NMSC.T> and Daiwa Securities Co
  Ltd &lt;DSEC.T>, Japan's two largest brokerage firms, are seeking
  a niche in the U.S. And European securities markets, while the
  country's huge banks are looking for strongholds in overseas
  banking, the takeover specialists said.
      Major trading houses, which see their profits evaporating
  in the heat of increased competition in merchandise trade, all
  have foreign businesses on their shopping lists.
      Among manufacturers, car parts makers are under the most
  pressure to buy up overseas companies and follow the big auto
  makers they subcontract for as these move offshore.
      ""The timing is favourable for Japanese parties to buy up
  potential overseas businesses, especially in the U.S. --
  Japan's largest market and where political risks are minimal,"" a
  takeover specialist at one trading company said.
      Japanese companies have become among the world's richest
  after a series of boom export years and as the yen has climbed
  against the dollar by some 40 pct in the past 18 months.
      But the yen's strength, which has also raised the costs of
  Japan's exports and allowed its Asian neighbours to move into
  its traditional markets, has frozen Japanese corporate growth,
  the specialists said.
      Looming trade friction is also threatening to erect more
  barriers against Japanese exports.
      Japanese firms see overseas acquisitions as a way to avoid
  the gloomy growth outlook and put their excess cash to work.
  Domestic interest rates, now at record lows, offer little
  investment opportunity.
      ""Japanese interest in acquisitions has been continuous, but
  the recent economic factors have become a driving force,"" said a
  banking industry source.
      So far, though, the Japanese are being cautious.
      While mergers and acquisitions among U.S. Firms number in
  the thousands, Japanese buyouts of overseas companies have
  totalled just a few dozen, one merchant banker said.
      Another merchant banker said that a flurry of Japanese
  acquisition activity was originally expected five years from
  now, but that time span appeared now to be too long.
      Japanese firms are becoming more aggressive now, he said.
      A turning point seemed to be Dainippon Ink and Chemicals
  Inc's &lt;DIAC.T> takeover bid for &lt;Sun Chemical Corp> of the U.S.
  Last year, which some analysts saw as somewhat hostile, he
  added.
      Dainippon Ink bought Sun Chemical's graphic arts group for
  550 mln dlrs late last year, after an earlier unsolicited bid
  for the whole company. Sun Chemical refused to sell its entire
  business after learning that Dainippon planned to liquidate all
  but its graphic arts-related businesses.
      Hostile takeovers are considered unethical and frowned upon
  by the Japanese, the trading company official says. ""Japanese
  people don't like fighting. They prefer peaceful amicable
  deals."" But now after some experience overseas, Japanese
  companies are acquainted with local practice, he adds. ""This is
  a healthy progression.""
      However, the experts do not expect the Japanese to run the
  board meetings of any giant U.S. Or European concerns.
      ""Japanese companies are not fully confident in managing a
  large U.S. Or European corporation,"" one banker said. ""They will
  expand their operations only gradually, a typical way for
  Japanese business.""
      A foreign merchant banker also noted, ""There are not many
  mega-deals left to do in the United States. A lot of the big
  deals there have already been done.""
      But medium-size and small concerns are potential targets of
  Japanese companies, the specialists said.
      Japanese will be aiming for new businesses in
  high-technology areas. ""Japanese companies had used technology
  and quality to get where they are and are unlikely to deviate
  from that trend,"" one takeover specialist said.
      Many are watching the results of the first acquisitions. If
  these succeed, activity could build, the specialists said.
      But few such specialists are going to sit back and wait
  until the action begins. Already, they said, Japanese trading
  houses, long-term credit and commercial banks, brokerages and
  foreign merchant banks have set up research sections to act as
  go-betweens in deals or find good buys for themselves.

3068,1,"CATHAY PACIFIC FORECASTS GOOD 1987 PERFORMANCE
  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HK>
  forecast another good year in 1987 in view of good growth in
  both passenger and cargo traffic volumes early this year over
  the year-earlier period.
      The airline did not quantify its performance in early 1987
  but said it would take delivery of one Boeing Co &lt;BA.N> 747
  freighter and one Boeing 747-300 passenger plane in September
  and November respectively after it took a 747-300 last month.
      It earlier reported a 58.7 pct increase in 1986 net profit
  to 1.23 billion H.K. Dlrs and announced a final dividend of 14
  cents a share.
      But Cathay Pacific recorded sharp increases in net finance
  charges to 124.9 mln dlrs from 44.4 mln a year.
      A spokesman for the firm linked the rise to two aircraft
  deliveries in 1986.
      However, the company said in a statement good returns from
  funds placed with investment managers had partly offset higher
  interest costs resulting from additional lease financing and
  other borrowing.
      It added that the airline last year also saw aviation fuel
  prices fall to an average 4.59 dlrs a gallon from 6.76 dlrs in
  1985.
      Passengers carried by Cathay Pacific totalled 4.2 mln last
  year, up from 3.85 in 1985, with the passengers kilometre
  travelled rising to 14.02 billion from 12.56 billion. But
  passenger load factor was down to 69.1 pct from 71.0 pct.
      The airline's cargo operations recorded growth of 21 pct in
  total tonnage over the previous year and a 35.9 pct rise in
  revenue to 1.79 billion dlrs.
      Cathay Pacific floated its shares in April, 1986 and is now
  50.23 pct owned by Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HK>, 16.43 pct by

  The Singapore government has taken

  loan stock certificates belonging to the company's chairman,
  Khoo Teck Puat, banking sources said.
      Khoo is a major shareholder of the &lt;National Bank of Brunei

  authorities alleged 90 pct of its loans of 1.3 billion Brunei
  dlrs had been extended to Khoo-related firms without
  documentation or guarantee.
      The Goodwood securities are now held by the Commercial
  Affairs Investigation Department, the banking sources said. The
  department declined to comment.
      The government move is aimed at protecting Goodwood's
  minority shareholders and securing Goodwood deposits at the
  NBB, the banking sources said.
      Goodwood had a total of 87.3 mln dlrs in fixed deposits,
  bank balances and accrued interest due from NBB as of last
  November, according to Goodwood's annual report.

  The state-owned Philippine National Bank
  (PNB) will fund Toyota Motor Corp's &lt;TOYO.T> planned purchase
  of its bankrupt former local partner's manufacturing facilities
  for at least 193 mln pesos, a bank official told reporters.
      Toyota has informed the Philippine government it plans to
  produce cars again here in joint venture with a local partner.
      It proposes to invest about 400 mln pesos in the
  manufacture of car spare parts and other items, and generate
  about 100 mln pesos in export earnings over five years.
      The banker said today a letter of intent was signed three
  weeks ago but the sale requires approval from government
  agencies charged with selling private sector assets taken over
  by state-owned banks.
      Official sources said Toyota's application was likely to be
  approved.
      Toyota severed ties with its Philippine partner of 20
  years, &lt;Delta Motor Corp>, in 1984 because the local company
  was suffering financial difficulties. PNB later foreclosed on

  The sale of the government's 25.55 pct

  sources closely linked with the transaction said.
      A spokesman for the Finance Ministry said no exact date had
  yet been set for the privatisation, which the government has
  tabled for the second half of March. However, he added a
  scandal at Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>, VW, over currency losses ""has
  nothing to do"" with the timing of the VEBA sale.
      Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg has said the sale of
  the Federal government's stake in VW, originally scheduled for
  later this year, may be delayed because of the currency affair.
      A banker involved in the VEBA placement said ""Nothing has
  changed in the planning. I still presume that it will take
  place in the second half of March.""
      This banker said there would be no reason to postpone the
  issue of the 10 mln VEBA shares for a few days. He added that
  the consortium which is arranging the deal had completed its
  preparatory work, although the price had not been decided.
      The VEBA share has been weaker ahead of the placement but
  West German stocks have been generally bearish and news of the
  VW scandal last week put further pressure on the market.

3076,1,"SONY FORESEES CONTINUED SLUMP IN EARNINGS
  Sony Corp &lt;SNE.T> group net income is
  expected to be down 65 pct for the five months ending March 31
  from the same period a year ago at around 10 billion yen, if
  the yendollar rate remains at the present level, managing
  director Tsunao Hashimoto told a press conference.
      Sony will have an irregular five-month business term ending
  March 31, as its financial year will be changed to run from
  April 1 to March 31 from the current October 31 year end.
      Group sales in the same period are estimated at about 550
  billion yen, down five pct from a year earlier, he said.
      The company earlier reported net income of 7.65 billion yen
  in the three month period ended January 31, down 59.2 pct from
  a year earlier, on sales of 343.06 billion, down 6.3 pct.
      The gloomy profits and sales resulted from the yen's recent
  appreciation against the dollar and a sharp drop in market
  prices due to severe sales competition at home and abroad.
      The yen rose 26 pct to an average of 159 yen to the dollar,
  reducing the company's total sales in the three month period by
  40 billion yen, Hashimoto said.
      Sales of 8-mm video camera/recorders totalled 300,000 units
  in the three months, unchanged from a year earlier, while
  Beta-format video tape recorders (vtrs) sales fell to 300,000
  from 350,000. Sales of compact disc players rose to 450,000
  from 300,000 and those of the Walkman rose to 2.25 mln from
  1.30 mln but colour television sales fell to 950,000 from one
  mln due to lower exports to China.
      Sales of 8-mm vtrs had already exceeded Beta-format vtrs
  sales since the beginning of fiscal 1986, Hashimoto said.
  Overseas sales accounted for 68.2 pct of the total in the three
  months compared with 71.3 pct a year earlier.
      Overseas production will account for 35 pct of its total
  production in 1990 from the present 20 pct.
      Hashimoto also said parent current profit in the five-month
  period is estimated at around 17 billion yen, down 33 pct from
  a year earlier, on sales of 400 billion, down 12 pct.
      Sony is hoping to retain at least 1985/86 levels of group
  net profits and sales in the new financial year starting April
  1 1987, he added. The company made 41.9 billion yen group net
  profit in the year ended November 31 1986, down 42.6 pct from a
  year earlier, on sales of 1,325 billion, down 6.7 pct.

      ""U.S. Law requires that at least 75 pct of shares in a U.S.

      The newspaper said that Air Atlanta, which flies to 11 U.S.

  Dixons Group Plc &lt;DXNS.L> said its
  tender offer for all of the common shares in &lt;Cyclops Corp> of
  the U.S. Expired at midnight yesterday and that it had accepted
  approximately 2.3 mln shares in the company at 90.25 dlrs each.
      This represents just over 54 pct of the outstanding shares
  on a fully diluted basis. But including shares already owned,
  Dixons now holds a total of 56 pct of the fully diluted
  outstanding shares.
      The company said it is now entitled to subscribe for all
  the authorised but unissued and unreserved shares of common
  stock of Cyclops, which total some 5.4 mln shares, at 90.25
  dlrs each.
      Dixons said it has waived its condition that 80 pct of the
  fully diluted outstanding shares be validly tendered and not
  withdrawn.
      Dixons launched the agreed 384 mln dlr offer on February 17
  this year in the wake of its unsuccessful battle to take over
  the U.K. Retail store chain Woolworth Holdings Plc &lt;WLUK.L>.
      Dixons shares were last quoted at 390p, up on last night's
  close of 380p.
      On Friday, &lt;CYACQ Corp>, an investor group formed by
  Audio/Video Affiliates Inc &lt;AVA> and Citicorp &lt;CCI>, said it
  would increase the price it was offering for all Cyclops shares
  to 92.50 dlrs from 80.00 dlrs each if Cyclops would provide it

3080,2,"AFG &lt;AFG>, WAGNER/BROWN BID FOR GENCORP &lt;GY>
  &lt;General Partners>, controlled by
  privately-held Wagner and Brown and by AFG Industries Inc, said
  it has started a tender offer for all common shares of GenCorp
  Inc and associated defensive preferred share purchase rights
  for 100 dlrs a share.
      GenCorp stock closed yesterday in composite tape trading at
  90.50 dlrs a share, up two dlrs on the day.
      In a newspaper advertisement, General Partners said the
  offer and withdrawal rights expire April 14 unless extended.
      General Partners said the offer is conditioned on receipt
  of sufficient financing to buy all shares on a fully diluted
  basis and receipt of enough shares to give General Partners at
  least 51 pct voting power, again fully diluted.
      It said the offer is also conditioned on GenCorp redeeming
  the defensive rights or General Partners being satisfied that
  the rights have been invalidated and General Partners obtaining
  from the Federal Communications Commission a special temporary
  authorization allowing completion of the acquisition of GenCorp
  shares.
      General Partners said it would set up voting trust
  arrangements pending review of its long-form application for
  FCC approval of its acquisition of control of GenCorp's
  broadcasting subsidiary.
      The partnership said the offer is further conditioned on
  GenCorp management withdrawing its proposals to amend the
  company's articles of incorporation and code of regulations to
  provide for an increase in authorized common shares, a
  classified board of directors and the elimination of cumulative
  voting.  The latter two changes would make it harder for
  minority shareholders to elect directors.
      General Partners said it is asking GenCorp for its
  shareholder lists for help in disseminating the offer.
      GenCorp has about 22.3 mln shares outstanding, making the
  value of the offer about 2.23 billion dlrs.
      Last fall, AFG and Wagner and Brown offered to acquire
  &lt;Lear Siegler Inc> for about 1.44 billion dlrs but withdrew the
  offer when higher bids emerged and due to complications of the
  Tax Reform Act of 1986.  Lear Siegler eventually went private
  for 1.66 billion dlrs.
      GenCorp is involved in tire and plasticmaking and aerospace
  as well as broadcasting.  The company faces challenges to its
  two television and 12 radio station licenses, partly becuase it
  failed to inform the FCC about allegedly improper foreign
  payments and political contributions.
      GenCorp has agreed to sell its New York-area television
  station WOR to MCA Inc &lt;MCA> for 387 mln dlrs and its Los
  Angeles station KHJ to Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS> for 217 mln dlrs.
  An investor group challenging the Los Angeles license would
  also receive 103 mln dlrs from Disney.
      For the year ended November 30, GenCorp earned 130 mln dlrs
  on sales of 3.10 billion dlrs.
      A GenCorp spokesman said the offer came as a surprise and
  the company was not yet in a position to comment on the bid.

  merger of two rival firms seeking to enter Japan's
  international telecommunications market, a senior industry
  official said.
      Fumio Watanabe, head of a telecommunications committee with
  the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren), told a
  news conference Japanese shareholders in the two consortiums
  agreed that the U.S. And British companies will be invited to
  participate in the new merged firm.
      The planned linkup will satisfy Tokyo's request that only
  one private company should enter the market.
      The two consortiums, &lt;International Digital Communications
  Planning Inc> (IDC) and &lt;International Telecom Japan> (ITJ),
  were set up in 1986 to compete with monopoly &lt;Kokusai Denshin
  Denwa Co> (KDD) after the market was deregulated in 1985.
      Watanabe said the Post and Telecommunications Ministry
  wanted only one competitor for the time being because of the
  size of the Japanese telcommunications market and that foreign
  investors will only be allowed to hold a minority stake.
      He estimated the two foreign firms' share in the merged
  consortium at less than three pct and added that even the
  largest shareholders could own only some five pct .
      Cable and Wireless and Japanese trading house &lt;C. Itoh and
  Co.> each have a 20 pct stake in the IDC consortium while
  Pacific Telesis and Merrill Lynch and Co. Inc. &lt;MER.N> jointly
  hold 13 pct .
      ITJ is headed by a rival group of trading houses. Several
  firms including Toyota Motor Corp. &lt;TOYO.T>  belong to both.
      Watanabe said progress was being made towards a merger
  agreement and added that Japanese industry agreed with the
  government on having only one private consortium as two
  companies might invest ""excessive"" amounts.
      He said talks with Cable &amp; Wireless will continue this

3105,2,"GENCORP &lt;GY> GROUP HOLDS 9.8 PCT STAKE
  (General Partners), a Texas general
  partnership equally owned by affiliates of Wagner and Brown and
  AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG>, said it currently holds 2,180,608
  common shares, or about 9.8 pct, of Gencorp Inc's &lt;GY>
  outstanding common stock.
      General Partners said it began a 100 dlrs a share cash
  tender offer for all of Gencorp, an Akron, Ohio-based concern,
  that is worth nearly 2.3 billion dlrs.
      Gencorp, which has interests in tire- and plastic-making,
  aerospace and broadcasting, has about 22.3 mln shares
  outstanding.
      The General Partners offer is subject to receipt of
  financing, a majority of Gencorp shares and other conditions.
      In a letter to Gencorp chairman and chief executive A.
  William Reynolds describing the offer, General Partners said it
  was willing to negotiate terms of the offer and was prepared to
  meet as soon as possible.
      In a statement, General Partners said it has contributed
  250 mln dlrs in equity financing and also has commitments for 
  a one billion dlr credit line from Wells Fargo and Co &lt;WFC> and
  a 1.25 billion loan from Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc,
  a unit of American Express Co &lt;AXP>.
      A Gencorp spokesman said the company's management was
  meeting but that its board was not scheduled to meet today. He
  said he was not sure the company had formally received notice
  of the offer but was aware of it through press accounts.
      He declined to say what Gencorp's next move might be or
  whether it would issue a statement later today.
      In the letter, General Partners said it plans to maintain
  Gencorp's corporate headquarters in Akron, and retain the
  company's plastics and industrial products businesses and its
  tires and related products segment.
      The letter did not mention Gencorp's RKO General
  broadcasting subsidiary, which has been involved in disputes
  over license renewals at several of its television stations.
  Gencorp has agreed to sell two of its independent stations, WOR
  in the New York area and KHJ in Los Angeles.
      General Partners officials were not immediately available.
      Gencorp shares were delayed at the opening on the New York
  Stock Exchange because of an imbalance of orders, and the NYSE
  said the shares were indicated to open at 103 to 115. The
  shares closed up two yesterday at 90-1/2, a new 52-week high.
      The financing for the offer includes the 250 mln dlrs in
  equity from General Partners, the 1.25 billion dlr loan from
  Shearson Lehman Brothers, a senior subordinated bridge loan for
  which a binding agreement can be delivered within 24 hours
  after a request from the partnership, and the one billion dlr
  credit line from Wells Fargo.
      Wells Fargo has agreed to lend up to 250 mln dlrs of the
  line itself and form a syndicate of banks to provide the rest,
  the partnership said.
      Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc will act as dealer manager in
  the tender offer, it said.
      In the letter, the partnership said it was confident it
  could obtain the financing and close the transaction promptly.
      Last fall AFG and privately held Wagner and Brown offered
  to acquired (Lear Siegler Inc) for about 1.44 billion dlrs but
  withdrew the offer when higher bids emerged. Lear Siegler
  eventually went private for about 1.66 billion dlrs.

"
3108,1,"MORGAN GRENFELL SAYS 1986 PROFITS HIT BY GUINNESS
  &lt;Morgan Grenfell Group Plc> said its
  1986 pre-tax profits were lower than forecast because of
  depreciation in the value of its Guinness Plc &lt;GUIN.L> shares
  and because of securities trading losses in the U.S.
      Morgan chairman Lord Catto said the losses on the group's
  seven mln Guinness shares in addition to a 3.5 mln dlr loss on
  its risk arbitrage operation in New York depressed profits some
  eight mln stg to 82.2 mln.
      He also told a news conference Morgan had received informal
  approaches about a takeover of the group but was not
  interested. No formal offers had been made, but Catto would not
  elaborate.
      Morgan Grenfell acted as merchant banker to Guinness during
  the brewing company's successful bid for Distillers Co Plc
  &lt;DIST.L> in the first half of last year.
      The U.K. Government launched an investigation into the
  affairs of Guinness last December. Public concern has focused
  on the way Guinness may have breached U.K. Company law and the
  Takeover Code by prompting others to support its share price
  during the bid.
      Morgan chief executive Christopher Reeves, head of
  corporate finance Graham Walsh and senior corporate finance
  director Roger Seelig all resigned in January over the Guinness
  affair.
      Another senior Morgan Grenfell executive, Geoffrey Collier,
  resigned late last year on allegations of trading on insider
  information. He currently faces criminal charges.
      Lord Catto said the second half of 1986 had been ""one of the
  most traumatic in our history,"" but that clients and staff had
  been supportive.
      ""I certainly look on the future in a positive way. We have
  the worst behind us and have swept nothing under the carpet.""
      Profits for the year, up 19.4 pct from 1985 pre-tax profits
  of 68.8 mln stg, were mainly due to a high contribution from
  corporate finance activities and progress in asset management.
      Finance Director David Ewart told the news conference the
  performance of the group so far in 1987 was ""within reasonable
  touch of the budget.""
      Lord Catto also said the group was actively seeking a new
  chief executive to replace Sir Peter Carey, who is acting as
  interim director after Reeves' resignation, and hopes to have a
  new chief executive within a few months.
      He also said Reeves and Walsh had been paid a total of
  562,000 stg in compensation following their resignations, but
  declined to say how much each man got. Negotiations were going
  on to determine an amount of compensation for Seelig, he said.
      Morgan Grenfell shares stood at a late 366p, 9p down on
  yesterday's 375p.

3109,2,"SEC MOVES TO DISCIPLINE ALLEGHENY INT'L &lt;AG>
  The Securities and Exchange
  Commission (SEC) staff is seeking authority to take enforcement
  action against Allegheny International Inc, the
  Pittsburgh-based industrial and consumer products firm said.
      Allegheny made the disclosure in documents filed with the
  SEC in connection with its recent agreement to be taken private
  through a leveraged buyout led by First Boston Inc.
      ""Following announcement of the merger agreement, the company
  was informed by the Enforcement Division of the (SEC) that it
  intends to seek authority from the commission to institute a
  proceeding against the company,"" Allegheny said.
      ""The company is cooperating in the commission's
  investigation which is continuing and now includes the taking
  of testimony of employes and others,"" Allegheny said.
      In the ongoing probe, Allegheny said, the staff has asked
  for information about company executive compensation and
  benefit plans, certain company-owned real estate, travel and
  entertainment spending and the use of corporate aircraft.
      It also has asked for information on acquisitions and
  divestitures, the company's accounting system ""and other
  internal controls,"" Allegheny said.
     The probe began in February 1986, Allegheny said.
      The SEC, as a matter of policy, routinely declines comment
  on its enforcement actions.
      The SEC investigation began just months before Allegheny
  became the target of a series of shareholder lawsuits claiming
  that the company had violated the federal securities laws by
  failing to disclose material matters in recent annual proxy
  statements.
      The suits, later consolidated into a single class-action
  complaint before a Pennsylvania federal court, allege
  securities law violations involving numerous current and former
  Allegheny officers and directors.
      Earlier this month, lawyers for the shareholders asked the
  court to expand the charges to include an allegation that, in
  the buyout, Allegheny had attempted to illegally freeze out its
  public shareholders at an unfair price.
      Allegheny said it intends to vigorously defend itself
  against all charges.
      The charges made in the shareholder suits are widely
  believed to have led to last summer's resignation of Chairman
  and Chief Executive Officer Robert Buckley.
      In the buyout, a group led by First Boston tendered March
  13 for all outstanding Allegheny shares at 24.60 dlrs a share.

  Audi AG &lt;NSUG.F>, the 99 pct owned
  subsidiary of Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>, said profit in 1986 fell
  by around half compared with 1985, when it achieved a record
  221 mln marks net profit, a rise of 19.5 pct on the previous
  year.
      Managing board chairman Wolfgang Habbel told a news
  conference he expected both profit and turnover to rise this
  year compared with 1986, but he said it was questionable
  whether 1987 profit would return to 1985 levels.
      He gave no figure for 1986 profit. Audi had predicted last
  year that 1986 profit would likely fall by an unspecified
  amount from 1985's record levels.
      Habbel said turnover in 1986 rose to 9.9 billion marks from
  9.6 billion in 1985 and looked certain to rise to over 10
  billion this year.
      Asked whether Audi would pay a dividend to VW to help the
  parent company overcome its currency losses, Habbel said Audi
  would ensure VW got a share of profits.
      Audi's entire 1985 net profit was paid into its own free
  reserves to help finance investment. In the previous 10 years
  VW had received 80 pct of Audi's earnings as a dividend.
      Habbel blamed the profit decline on disruptions to output
  caused by the introduction of the new Audi 80 model, on
  currency factors and on negative publicity in the U.S. About
  alleged ""sudden acceleration"" of some of its Audi 5000 models.
      As reported, Audi's sales in the U.S. Dropped nearly 20 pct
  to 59,800 last year.
      Habbel said the U.S. Sales decline would probably bottom
  out in 1987.
      Audi's worldwide car deliveries fell two pct to 363,000.
      Of the total, exports fell 10.5 pct to a rounded 210,000,
  but domestic sales increased to a rounded 154,000 from 137,180
  in 1985.
      Habbel said the new Audi 80 had sold extremely well in the
  first two months of 1987, helping Audi to increase its overall
  market share in West Germany to 8.4 pct from 5.2 pct in the
  same months of 1986. Sales in Europe also rose but U.S. Sales
  fell further, he said without giving details. Worldwide
  deliveries in the first two months increased eight pct to
  57,000.
      Audi said in January that 1987 car production would rise to
  over 400,000 from 384,000 in 1986, when output had fallen
  compared with 1985's 392,000.
      Habbel said Audi expected the rise in output to lead to
  further new hiring of employees.
      At the end of 1986 Audi's workforce stood at a record
  39,800, a rise of 3,400 over 1985.

3152,1,"CONT'L ILLINOIS&lt;CIL> SAYS MORATORIUM MAY CUT NET
  Continental Illinois Corp said if the
  Brazilian debt moratorium remains in effect, it may place its
  medium and long term loans to Brazil on a cash basis.
      This would increase non-performing loans by about 380 mln
  dlrs and reduce income before taxes and net income by about 10
  mln dlrs in the 1987 first quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full
  year, company officials told a press briefing.
      Loans to Brazil at 1986 year end totaled 474 mln dlrs,
  according to the annual report released at the briefing.
      In February 1987, the Brazilian government, citing a
  declining level of foreign currency reserves, declared a
  moratorium on the payment of interest on the country's medium
  and long term debt obligations.
      Continental said it may take similar action on its loans to
  Ecuador, which total 25 mln dlrs. This would reduce 1987

3164,1,"CONT'L ILLINOIS &lt;CIL> SEES IMPACT FROM TAX REFORM
  The Tax Reform Act of 1986 will have a
  substantial impact on Continental Illinois Corp, the company's
  annual report says.
      One provision repeals the reserve method of providing for
  bad debts for banks with over 500 mln dlrs in assets and
  requires that tax loan loss reserves taken in the past, be
  restored to current earnings status, it said.
      As a result, those amounts will be subject to federal
  taxes, it said. No amounts were disclosed.
      Continental said it decided to deal with this change ""in
  its entirety"" in 1987.
      Tax reform will also change foreign tax credit limitation
  rules, and although the impact will not be material in the
  short term, the Act will require, for the first time, that
  income from certain foreign subsidiaries be taxable, the report
  said.
      The new legislation also reduces existing tax credits by
  17.5 pct in 1987 and 35 pct in 1988 and later years, it said.
      Continental's investment tax credits carryforwards of 12.8
  mln dlrs at 1986 year end will be reduced to 10.6 mln dlrs in
  1987 and, if not used in 1987, to 8.3 mln dlrs in 1988, it
  said.
      Another provision of the Act could result in limiting the
  use of tax credits if a change in ownership of Continental
  takes place, the report said.
      This could happen if the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp
  sells enough shares of Continental's common stock over the next
  two years to cause a change in ownership, it noted.
      In December, the FDIC sold about one-third of its junior
  convertible preference stock in Continental to the public in
  the form of common stock.

  Morrison Knudsen Corp said its

  its National Steel and Shipbuilding unit.
      The company earned 39.4 mln dlrs in 1986, including pretax
  gains of 11.5 mln dlrs from pension income and 7,400,000 dlrs

  41.5 mln dlrs in 1985.
      It said ""Lower than expected levels of new work booked in

  year have delayed the expected growth in the engineering and
  construction area.""  The company said it will remain profitable
  in 1987 and results should strengthen as the year progresses. 
  It attributed the decline in new work to more stringent bidding
  standards and a competitive market.

  companies if the sale was not in the national or economic
  interest.                
      The takeover provision was sent to the full Energy and
  Commerce Committee for consideration as part of the overall
  trade bill which is being written by several House committees.
      The subcommittee's bill would bar imports of digital audio
  recording equipment that is not made with anti-copying chips.
  This provision is designed to protect U.S. companies from the
  unauthorized use of U.S. designs in foreign products.
      The bill calls for an investigation of whether U.S.
  engineering and construction firms are given adequate
  opportunity to bid on Japan's civil works procurement practices

3197,2,"TALKING POINT/GENCORP INC &lt;GY>
  The surprise 2.2 billion-dlr tender
  offer for Ohio-based conglomerate GenCorp Inc will not be
  enough to buy the company, analysts said.
      Analysts estimated the 100 dlr-per-share offer from General
  Partners is 10 to 20 dlrs per share below the breakup value of
  GenCorp. However, market sources and analysts said  uncertainty
  surrounds any transaction because of the legal challenges to
  Gencorp broadcasting licenses.
      Gencorp's stock rose 15-3/4 to 106-1/4 in heavy trading.
      ""The expectation is either there will be someone else or
  the bidder will sweeten the offer hoping to get management's
  cooperation,"" said Larry Baker, an analyst with E.F. Hutton
  group.
      Analysts said there is concern about challenges to
  Gencorp's broadcast licenses for two television and 12 radio
  stations. Some of the disputes, dating back about 20 years,
  were brought by groups that alleged improper foreign payments
  and political contributions.
      ""I think it kind of muddies an already muddy situation,""
  said Baker of the offer.
      Some arbitragers said they were concerned the ongoing issue
  might be a stumbling block or result in a long period of time
  for any transaction.
      A source close to General Partners, however, said General
  Partners would apply to the Federal Communications Commission
  for special temporary authority to hold the broadcast stations.
  The source said if approved, the authority would allow a
  transaction to be carried out.
      If it received the ""short-form"" approval, General Partners
  would set up a trust which would hold the broadcasting
  properties until the licensing situation is resolved.
      General Partners is equally owned by investors Wagner and
  Brown and glass-maker AFG Industries Inc.
      Some market sources speculated an outside buyer, such as
  General Partners, might even be be a catalyst to resolution of
  the challenges since it would carry out GenCorp's plan to sell
  the stations.
      GenCorp earlier this month reached an agreement with Walt
  Disney Co to sell its Los Angeles television station, WHJ-TV.
  Disney would pay 217 mln dlrs to GenCorp and 103 mln dlrs to a
  group that challenged the station's license.
      GenCorp also has a pending agreement to sell WOR-TV in
  Secaucus, N.J. to MCA Inc for 387 mln dlrs.
      General Partners said it intends to keep the company's
  plastics and industrial products businesses and its tires and
  related products segment.
      Charles Rose, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co, said
  that, on a breakup valuation, the company might be worth as
  much as 125 dlrs per share. Rose estimated the aerospace
  business could bring 30 to 40 dlrs per share or one billion
  dlrs, as would DiversiTech, the plastics unit. Broadcasting,
  including assets pending sale, might be 30 to 40 dlrs per
  share, he said.
      The company, formerly known as General Tire
  and Rubber Co, also has a tire business Rose estimated would be
  worth five to 10 dlrs per share. He estimated the bottling
  business might also be worth several dollars per share, he
  said.
      Analysts said GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds, who
  became chairman last year, has been emphasizing the company's
  Aerojet General and DiversiTech General businesses. GenCorp,
  founded in 1915, became an unfocused conglomerate over the
  years and analysts believe reynolds has helped it to improve.
      ""The management's doing a very fine job in trying to deal
  with the non-strategic assets of the company,"" Rose said.
      Analysts expect GenCorp to resist the tender offer, but
  they declined to predict what steps the company might take.
  They said it would be possible the company might consider a
  leveraged buyout or restructuring to fend off the offer.
      General Partners holds 9.8 pct of GenCorp stock, and there
  was some concern about ""greenmail."" Greenmail is the payment at
  a premium for an unwanted shareholders' stock.
      ""I would doubt they would greenmail them, but nothing
  surprises me anymore,"" said Rose.
      GenCorp has not commented on the offer. It has retained
  First Boston Corp and Kidder, Peabody and Co as advisers.

      Fleet said the deal is expected to be completed by July one
  1988, the date on which the nationalization of Rhode Island's
  interstate banking law takes effect.
      For the full year ended december 31, Fleet, a Rhode Island
  based bank holding company, reported net income of 136.7 mln
  dlrs and assets of 11.7 billion dlrs. Norstar, an Albany N.y.
  holding company, reported net income of 104.8 mln dlrs and
  assets of 11.1 billion dlrs.
       Fleet comptroller Irv Goss said it is estimated that the
  transaction will result in minimal dilution in Fleet/Norstar
  earnings per share. It is the intention of both companies that
  cash quarterly dividends following the combination not decline
  for either company's stock holders, the company said.
      For 1986, Norstar issued 1.31 dlrs annually in cash
  dividends on its common stock. Fleet's current annual
  distibution on a pre-split basis would be equivalent to 1.68
  dlrs a share.
      In addition, Fleet and Norstar have each granted the other
  an option to purchase such number of authorized buy unissued
  shares of common stock, that will constitute 24.99 pct of the
  fully diluted shares outstanding.
      The transaction is subject to both regulatory and
  shareholder approval.
      The companies said that after the proposed merger, the
  combined banking holding wil be among the 25 largest in the
  country.

"
3225,1,"CONT'L ILLINOIS SEES MONTHS OF BRAZIL DEBT TALKS
  Continental Illinois Corp's &lt;CIL>
  Chairman John Swearingen said he sees negotiations to
  reschedule Brazil's debt payments taking at least three to six
  months.
      Brazil declared last month a moratorium on payment of
  interest on its medium- and long-term debts. The moratorium is
  expected to persist the entire time that debt scheduling talks
  are under way.
      ""I believe it will take three to six months, maybe longer,
  for an arrangement to be worked out to reschedule Brazil's
  debt,"" Swearingen told reporters at a press briefing.
      ""I think Brazil will pay its debts in the long run. Just
  how long the run is is anybody's guess,"" Swearingen said.
      Earlier the bank holding company said Brazil's moritorium
  may force it to increase non-performing loans by 380 mln dlrs
  and reduce pretax and net income by 10 mln dlrs in the first
  quarter and 35 mln dlrs for the full year.
      The bank will decide March 31 whether to characterize these
  loans as non-performing, William Ogden, chairman of the
  Continental Illinois National Bank and Trust Co of Chicago,
  Continental's largest subsidiary, said in response to an
  inquiry.
      Ogden said the moratoriums will affect both pretax and net
  income equally because the banking firm has tax credits to use.
      Swearingen predicted an increase in operating profits for
  1987 because he sees higher income and reduced expenses.
  Continental will reduce expenses through job cuts and reducing
  office rental costs. In 1986 it cut about 850 positions.
      In 1986 it had net profits of 165.2 mln dlrs or 60 cts a
  share, up from 150.5 mln dlrs or 53 cts a share.
      The bank transferred 459 mln dlrs of poor-quality loans and
  other assets to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, FDIC,
  during 1986. It can transfer bad loans under the terms of the
  1984 restructuring agreement with the government.
      The bank will transfer the remaining 460 mln dlrs that it
  is entitled to transfer to FDIC by September 26, 1987,
  Swearingen said. It will choose loans based on ultimate loss
  rather than their immediate effect on non-performing loans.
      In 1986 the bank's loans to the Midwest's middle market
  rose 20 pct at a time of overall weak loan demand in the U.S.
      Concerning banking acquisitions, Swearingen said the bank
  would like to buy additional suburban Chicago banks. In 1986 it
  bought three small suburban banks.
      Swearingen said he is concerned that Continental will be
  taken over because no bank in the Midwest region is large
  enough to buy it, and New York money center banks are
  prohibited by law from buying Illinois banks.
      He said, however, that the FDIC still has control over who
  will eventually own the firm because it still holds the
  equivalent of 148 mln common shares out of a total 215 mln.
      The FDIC sold 52 mln shares to the public last year and has
  said it intends to sell the rest as quickly as possible. The
  agency received the shares as part of its 4.5 billion dlrs 1984
  bailout of the bank.
      Swearingen, who came out of retirement in 1984 to head the
  struggling banking firm after a career as an oil industry
  executive, said he will retire when the three-year period he
  agreed to be Continental chairman ends in August. He would not
  comment on a successor.
      The bank will expand its First Options of Chicago options
  clearning unit into Tokyo, Swearingen said, but said its
  doubtful lending to Japan will occur because that country
  doesn't need external sources of cash.

  Fairchild Semiconductor Corp
  president Donald Brooks said he intends to take a management
  buyout proposal to the company's parent at some point in the
  future and substantial funding is available for such a
  purchase.
      Fairchild is owned by Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>.
      Brooks also told a press conference that if management is
  successful, it may later attempt to take the company public.
      ""I am sure that if such a management buyout is to occur,
  and I am hopeful that it does, the public market is one of the
  avenues we will ultimately have to use to raise capital,""
  Brooks said.
      Brooks also said the company would continue to attempt an
  exchange of technology and manufacturing agreement with Fujitsu
  Ltd if successful in its buyout bid.
      Futjitsu withdrew an offer to acquire some 80 pct of
  Fairchild, a semiconductor maker, after U.S. government
  officials expressed opposition to the transaction.
      Brooks told the news conference that any purchase would be
  in the form of a management buyout and not a leveraged buyout.
      He also said the transaction could be financed through a
  debt issue or conventional financing from investors.
      Brooks said management is pleased by a number of investment
  proposals bought to them, but he added, ""the investors must be
  willing to invest in the future growth of the company and not
  just selling off assets.""
      Brooks also said he was not aware of any direct
  intervention by the U.S. in an attempt to block the merger.
      ""I am not aware of any direct contact between Washington
  and Fujitsu, but that doesn't mean it doesn't exist,"" Brooks

3231,1,"CPC &lt;CPC> SEES 1987 HIGHER EARNINGS PER SHARE
  CPC International Inc said it expects

      ""We are confident that 1987 will top 1986 in earnings per
  share and are optimistic about our longer-term future as well,""
  the company said in its 1986 annual report.
      In 1986, CPC earned 219.2 mln dlrs, or 2.30 dlrs a share,
  on revenues of 4.55 billion dlrs compared with income of 142
  mln dlrs or 1.46 dlrs on sales of 4.21 billion dlrs in 1985.
  The share figures are adjusted for a 2-for-1 split paid in
  January.
      A share buyback program started last year reduced the
  number of shares outstanding to 82.6 mln at year-end 1986 from
  97.2 mln dlrs the end of 1985, adjusted for the split.
      The food and grocery products company also said it was the
  subject of five stockholder lawsuits and one class action suit,
  filed last November and December in Delaware, New York and New
  Jersey.
      The suits are related to the company's purchase of its
  shares from Salomon Brothers Inc after Salomon bought a block
  of the stock from Ronald Perelman, who had acquired nearly 3.7
  mln CPC shares, or 7.6 pct of the company, last year.
      The suits allege the company bought the shares back at an
  artificially inflated price, violating securities laws,
  breaching directors' fiduciary duties and wasting corporate
  assets.

  Carolina Power and Light Co said
  its board has decided to cancel coal-fired Mayo Unit Two, the
  second unit planned for its Mayo Plant in Person County, N.C.
      The company said the 690,000 kilowatt unit was only about
  one pct complete and was scheduled for commercial service in
  1992.
      Carolina Power said the status of the unit had been under
  review because of a decision by the North Carolina
  Environmental Management Commission that would have required
  the unit to be equipped with expensive sulphur dioxide-removing
  scrubbers.
      Carolina Power said Unit One, which has been in operation
  since 1983, meets all air quality regulations without scrubbers
  through the use of low-sulphur coal, and ""The addition of
  scrubbers to Mayo Unit Two would have produced only marginal
  air quality improvements.""
      The company said it will be able to purchase lower-cost
  power from Duke Power Co &lt;DUK> for intermediate and peaking
  purposes than the projected cost of power from Mayo Two with
  scrubbers.  It said it will retain the Mayo Two site for later
  development of a generating unit.
      Carolina Power said Mayo Two was projected to cost about
  877 mln dlrs, including 200 mln dlrs for scrubbers.  ""The
  higher construction costs, plus higher operating costs, would
  increase the cost of power produced by Mayo Unit Two with
  scrubbers by about 90 mln dlrs per year.""
      A company spokesman said the company has already spent
  about 23 mln dlrs on Mayo Two. He said no estimate has yet been
  made of the cost of canceling the plant, but the company does
  not expect to take a charge against earnings.  He said Carolina
  Power intends to include the cancellation costs in rate filings
  it will make late this year or early next year.

  New England Electric System &lt;NES>
  expects its cash construction spending to reach 205 mln dlrs
  this year, up from 188 mln dlrs in 1986, the utility said in
  material distributed at an analysts meeting.
      It said spending is expected to advance to 215 mln dlrs in
  1988 and 220 mln dlrs in 1989.
      The utility said these totals exclude spending on New
  England Hydro-Transmission being built to import electricity
  from Quebec Hydro. New England Electric is the operator of this
  venture as well as owning 51 pct of the project.
      The venture expects to spend 65 mln dlr this year, 105 mln
  dlrs next year and 125 mln dlrs in 1989 to build transmission
  lines from northern Quebec into New England, the utility said.
      New England Electric said internally generated funds will
  cover all of its power plant construction costs this year and
  65 pct of the 108 mln dlrs its retail distribution units plan
  to spend in 1987.
      The company said it also expects to spend 60 mln dlrs on
  its oil and gas activities this year, adding internally
  generated funds are expected to provide 85 pct of this total.
      New England Electric said it plans to issue 30 mln dlrs
  worth of pollution control bonds in 1987 and retire additional
  higher cost preferred stock. Its Granite State Electric unit
  plans to issue five mln dlrs of long term notes early this year
  as well.
      The company said it does not plan to offer common shares
  this year or in the foreseeable future, but expects to raise
  about 40 mln dlrs in equity through the sale of stock under its
  dividend reinvestment plan and employee share plans.
      President Samuel Huntington told the analysts the
  construction spending projection is based on the expectation
  that demand for electricity in the New England electric system
  will grow about two pct a year for the next 15 years.
      However, the utility cannot ignore the potential for
  sharper growth, he said, pointing out that demand was up 5.2
  pct in 1986 and 4.7 pct per year in the past four years.
      He attributed this growth to declining electricity prices
  and a strong New England economy.
      Huntington said New England Elecetric has ""all but rejected
  new coal fired plants"" to supply additional power.
      He said the most attractive new power supplies are those
  with short lead times which can be built in modules.
      Later, vice president Glenn Schleede said the utility is
  looking at gas-fired, combined cycle generating units to supply
  most of its new power needs, but has not rejected coal-fired
  fluidized bed units.
      He explained that fluidized bed technology is available in
  modular units, adding that Huntington was referring to the
  traditional coal-fired plant which burns pulverized coal.

3249,1,"CPI CORP &lt;CPIC> TO POST HIGHER 1986 RESULTS
  CPI Corp said it expects to post
  higher sales and earnings for its fiscal year ended February 7
  when it officially reports results in three weeks.
      It said preliminary figures show total sales of 258 mln
  dlrs, up 30 pct from 198 mln dlrs in its 1985 fiscal year. Net
  earnings from continuing operations rose to 18 mln dlrs, up
  almost 31 pct from 13.9 mln dlrs, while per share earnings from
  continuing operations were 2.22 dlrs, up 23 pct from 1.80 dlrs.
  There were 552,500 additional shares outstanding.

3250,1,"LAIDLAW TRANSPORTATION &lt;LDMFA> SEES BETTER YEAR
  Laidlaw Transportation Ltd said
  earnings per share for the current fiscal year should increase
  by ""substantially more"" than the 30 pct average annual growth
  experienced in the last four years.
      Revenues for the year ended August 31 will be about 1.2
  billion dlrs, including GSX Corp, the U.S. waste services unit
  acquired from Imasco Ltd last year for 358 mln dlrs, Laidlaw
  president Michael de Groote told analysts.
      Last year, Laidlaw had operating earnings of 66.2 mln dlrs,
  or 63 cts per share, on revenues of 717.8 mln dlrs.
      De Groote also said the company expects ""excellent results""
  in the second quarter ended February 28, but would not be more
  specific.
      He said his revenue estimate for fiscal 1987 does not
  include possible further acquisitions and said that the
  addition of GSX will produce increasing benefits in fiscal 1988
  through fiscal 1990.
      De Groote said the increased earnings in the previous four
  quarters was due partly to internal growth of about 15 pct. The
  rest came from acquisitions, he said.
      Laidlaw expects to sell a small rubber recycling operation,
  a subsidiary of GSX, within the next few weeks, but this will
  not make any material contribution to earnings, de Groote said.
      He also said he is ""not very optimistic"" about the ongoing
  negotiations to buy 50 pct of Tricil Ltd, a Toronto-based
  chemical and solid waste services company with Canadian and
  U.S. operations, from &lt;Trimac Ltd> of Calgary.
      De Groote said that, regardless of the outcome of the
  proposed Tricil acquisition, Laidlaw will decide within the
  next 30 days whether to stay in the North American chemical
  waste business through GSX Corp.
      ""We feel it is a profitable business with good growth
  potential and we now want to stay in it if we can get the right
  management,"" de Groote said.
      Laidlaw financed the acquisition of GSX by its U.S.
  subsidiary, Laidlaw Transportation Inc, with the proceeds of a
  200 mln Canadian dlr preferred stock issue and borrowing.
      De Groote said the company will gain about 138 mln dlrs in
  cash by August 31 from the exercise of warrants.
      De Groote also said waste services in fiscal 1987 will
  represent about 49 pct of revenues, school buses will
  contribute 49 pct and trucking about two pct.
      The trucking subsidiary in western Canada is performing
  well and there are no plans to sell it, he said.
      He would not estimate the contribution of each segment to
  earnings per share for the year. He also said that further
  acquisitions of school bus operations in the U.S. are likely
  within the next few months.

3257,1,"U.S. BANK INCOME SHOWS FIRST DROP IN 25 YEARS
  Problems in the farmbelt and
  oilpatch regions contributed to the first decline in overall
  income for U.S. banks in a quarter century, the Federal Deposit
  Insurance Corp (FDIC) said.
      The nation's 14,181 commercial banks had net income of 17.8
  billion dlrs in 1986, down slightly from 1985's record 18.1
  billion dlrs.
      The total was still the second highest ever reported, but
  it was the first time income had not grown since 1961.
      The figures reflected a radical split in the health of
  banks in the two halves of the country, the FDIC said.
      In the East, one in 12 banks had losses last year, while
  one in four banks west of the Mississippi River had losses.
      Nationwide, one out of five banks reported losses, the FDIC
  said in the first of a new series of quarterly banking profiles
  it planned to issue.
      ""I don't remember a time when there was such a clear
  distinction by geographic area,"" FDIC Chairman William Seidman
  told reporters.
      He said that while the figures were not good, they showed
  the problem did not lie with the banking system as a whole but
  with regional differences in economic performance.
      Some 44 banks have failed so far this year, twice as many
  as failed by this time a year ago, but Seidman said he doubted
  the pace would continue. 
      On a positive note, banks increased capital to a record 208
  billion dlrs last year, and there has been a slowing in the
  number of new problem banks in all regions except the
  Southwest, Seidman said.
      Banks' provision for losses from bad loans in the fourth
  quarter increased to 21.7 billion dlrs, a 23 pct rise from a
  year ago.
      Large banks -- those with assets of one billion dlrs or
  more -- reporting fourth-quarter losses totaled 22, the FDIC
  said.
      Seidman said it was too early to say what effect Brazil's
  moratorium on debt interest payments would have on U.S. banks.
      He said bank deregulation had given managers more freedom
  to run their banks and that an increase in failures was to be
  expected.
      But this freedom from regulatory restraints also has meant
  other banks that were better managed have gotten stronger,
  Seidman said.

      Hawker Siddeley said it set aside a provision of 7.7 mln
  dlrs for the proposed sale.
      It also said lower 1986 earnings were due to much lower
  earnings in transportation equipment and losses in steel
  castings and forgings, which offset gains in the mining sector
  and improvements in forestry equipment.
      Hawker Siddeley also said demand for new railway equipment
  was limited with export sales frequently restrained by
  customers' financing difficulties.
      Demand for steel castings and wheels for Canadian railways
  continued to be very depressed with maintenance requirements at
  the lowest level in the past decade.
      However, there was demand for industrial casting due to
  increased hydro-electric power generation, the company said.

      The Orenda division maintained a high level of activity in

      Gabelli said he also proposes that management consider
  spinning off all assets, other than the GenCorp broadcast
  properties, to shareholders. The licenses of the broadcast
  properties have long been entangled in a series of challenges.
      ""One thing is going to be clear and that is I'm going to

      Gabelli said he fears that greenmail might be a motivation
  in the offer.

3288,1,"LAENDERBANK EXPECTS MODEST PROFIT RISE IN '87
  Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG
  [OLBV.VI] expects to maintain its dividend and to record a
  moderate rise in profits this year after the 181.5 mln
  schilling net profit made in 1986, General Director Gerhard
  Wagner said.
      Wagner told a news conference that last year's 34.3 pct
  rise in net profit from 135.1 mln in 1985 was largely due to
  greater domestic business and wider margins on schilling
  interest rates.
      The bank, Austria's third largest, raised its 1986 dividend
  to 12 pct of its 1.5 billion schilling nominal share capital
  from 10 pct on capital of 1.35 billion in 1985.
      Announcing the 1986 results, Wagner said: ""We will endeavour
  to maintain the higher dividend in 1987.""
      Laenderbank's balance sheet total rose five pct to 197.7
  billion schillings against 8.1 pct growth in 1985. Foreign
  currency business last year accounted for some 37 pct of
  balance sheet total compared with about 41 pct in 1985.
      Wagner blamed the realtive shrinkage of foreign business
  chiefly on the dollar's fall against the schilling, which is
  effectively pegged to the mark. The dollar's weakness had wiped
  some 8.9 billion schillings off the balance sheet total.
      Wagner declined to give an exact figure for profits from
  the bank's London branch, which opened in April 1985, but said
  that it came close to one mln stg.
      On schilling lending, profit on interest had risen 18 pct
  to 2.19 billion schillings while commission earnings climbed
  8.7 pct to 738.9 mln.
      According to the 1987 federal budget, the state is due to
  lower its stake 60 pct in Laenderbank, probably to 51 pct.
  Wagner said the exact timing of the move depended on the state.

3300,2,"AIR CANADA COURIER BUY SHARPLY ALTERS INDUSTRY
  Air Canada's 54 mln U.S. dlr
  acquisition of Gelco Corp's &lt;GEC> Canadian unit has
  dramatically altered Canada's fast growing courier industry,
  largely dominated by U.S. companies until this year, company
  officials and analysts said.
      State-owned Air Canada takes over the country's second
  largest overnight courier business just two months after
  another Canadian company, &lt;Onex Capital Corp Ltd>, approved the
  acquisition of number one ranked Purolator Courier Ltd from New
  Jersey-based Purolator Courier Corp &lt;PCC>.
      But analysts said the two acquisitions were prompted by
  financial restructuring undertaken by the U.S. parent companies
  and likely don't represent an industry trend toward buying out
  foreign owned courier operations.
      ""It's a case of whether you can buy from the right people at
  the right time,"" McLeod Young Weir Ltd transportation analyst
  Tony Hine commented.
      The two acquisitions fit with a larger move by U.S.
  companies embroiled in a take-over or restructuring to sell-off
  their Canadian units to generate ready cash, said Nesbitt
  Thomson Deacon Inc analyst Harold Wolkin.
      ""There is a very good correlation between the U.S. parent
  selling Canadian subsidiaries and the U.S. parent either being
  under siege or taking someone else over,"" he said.
      Gelco Corp, of Minnesota, decided to sell Gelco Express Ltd
  as part of its previously announced program to sell off four
  operating units to buy back shares and pay down debt, Gelco
  Express marketing vice president James O'Neil told Reuters.
      The sale is the first under Gelco's divestiture program,
  and proceeds will be used to help pay down 350 mln U.S. dlrs of
  debt by year-end, the company said.
      While company officials declined to disclose earnings and
  revenue figures, O'Neil said Gelco Express holds a dominant
  position in the industry, handling more than 50,000 packages a
  day and generating revenues of more than 100 mln Canadian dlrs
  a year.
      The earlier move by Purolator to sell its Canadian unit
  formed an important part of a company restructuring program,
  adopted after another Canadian Company, &lt;Unicorp Canada Corp>,
  acquired a 12.6 pct stake in Purolator and said it would
  consider acquiring the whole company.
      Last month, Purolator agreed to be acquired by a company
  formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of
  Purolator's U.S. courier business.
      For Air Canada, its acquisition of Gelco's Canadian courier
  business represents an ""excellent financial investment"" in a
  market it sees growing by 25 to 30 pct annually, spokesman
  Esther Szynkarsky said.
      The airline also announced it acquired a 65 pct stake in
  EMS Corp, of Calgary, an in-city messenger service.
      It did not disclose financial terms, but Szynkarsky said
  the two acquisitions totalled about 90 mln Canadian dlrs, and
  the two business have combined yearly revenues of 170 mln dlrs.
      She said the acquisition fit with Air Canada's strategy of
  seeking attractive investments that compliment its main airline
  business.
      Gelco will continue to operate with current management,
  independently of Air Canada, although Air Canada already
  operates its own air cargo business that includes a small
  door-to-door courier operation.
      ""They're well run, they're a good investment, they're doing
  well in a growing market, and that's the way we want to keep
  it,"" Szynkarsky said.
      Analyst Hine said the Gelco and Purolator Canadian units
  will likely retain operating links with their U.S. delivery
  network, generating traffic for the former parent companies
  without them having to tie up capital in Canada.
      ""The nature of the business is that incremental traffic is
  incremental revenue,"" Hine said.
      ""It's sort of a sausage maker business where you put in
  place the sausage grinder, and the more sausage you can stuff
  through, the more money you make,"" he added.

      Treasury Financial Secretary Norman Lamont made the

      The acquisition was contingent on its ability to obtain

      The company further stated that it has a 1.7 mln dlr

3334,2,"FLEET &lt;FLT> AIMS TO SPEED MERGER WITH NORSTAR
  Fleet Financial Group hopes its
  proposed merger with Norstar Bancorp &lt;NOR>, ranked as the
  largest U.S. banking merger, can be completed by the beginning
  of 1988, according to an executive of Fleet.
      Robert Lougee, director of corporate communications for
  Rhode Island-based Fleet, told Reuters the company is exploring
  the possiblity of seeking a change in the national trigger date
  for the state's reciprocal bank law to Jan 1, 1988 from July
  one. The decision is up to the Rhode Island legislature.
      The merger plan was announced in a midday news release that
  said the deal, worth about 1.3 billion dlrs, would be
  consummated July one when Rhode Island barriers to interstate
  banking outside of New England come down. ""If we can consummate
  the deal earlier that would be better for all concerned,""
  Lougee said. He said to the best of his knowledge a change in
  the Rhode Island law would not be a hardship for any other
  banking institution in the state.
      He said Fleet is optimstic Connecticut law, which only
  permits interstate banking mergers within New England, can be
  amended. Fleet owns First Connecticut Bancorp.
      If the Connecticut law is not amended in time, Lougee said,
  an option would be to spin off that unit with repurchase
  provisions.
      The New England reciprocal banking laws have excluded New
  York as a means of protecting regional banks from being gobbled
  up by the money center giants.
      Wall Street analysts said the merger accord between Fleet
  and Albany, N.Y.-based Norstar demonstrates the rapid pace of
  interstate banking mergers since state legislatures begain
  permitting regional mergers on a reciprocal basis. The U.S.
  Supreme Court decided in mid-1985 to permit the mergers.
      Fleet and Norstar in a joint statement billed the proposed
  merger as ""a partnership of two companies."" Both will continue
  to operate existing headquarters after the merger.
      Norstar holders will receive 1.2 Fleet shares for each one
  of theirs following Fleet's previously announced two-for-one
  split. Fleet shares closed today at 59-1/2, up 1/8, giving the
  deal an indicated value of 1.3 billion dlrs.
      That topped the proposed merger of Los Angeles-based
  Security Pacific Corp &lt;SPC> and Seattle's Rainier Bancorpartion
  &lt;RBAN>. The West Coast deal, announced about four weeks ago, is
  worth an estimated 1.2 billion dlrs.
      Chemical New York Corp's &lt;CHL> acquisition of Texas
  Commerce Bancshares last year was valued at about 1.2 billion
  dlrs, making it similar in size to the Security Pacific-Rainer
  deal. The California combination of Wells Fargo and Co &lt;WFC>
  and Crocker National Corp last year was worth 1.1 billion dlrs
  and there have been several bank mergers in the southeast
  valued in the 700-800 mln dlr range.
      ""It's a merger of equals,"" said analyst John Rooney of
  Moseley Securities Corp. He said Norstar had a book value at
  the end of 1986 of 19.63 dlrs per share, while Fleet's book
  value was 28.02 dlrs.
      Rooney noted that Norstar chairman Peter Kiernan is in his
  60's while Fleet's Terrence Murray is in his late 40's. He said
  Kiernan would probably head the combined company until his
  retirement then Murray could assume the top post.
      Analyst Thaddeus Paluszek of Merrill Lynch and Co said
  Fleet's earnings would have been diluted about two pct in 1986
  on the basis of the merger terms announced today.
      He noted that Fleet has a ""teriffic reputation"" after
  having diversified in a number of financial areas. Fleet has
  established consumer banks in the southeast and is known as an
  innovator in securitization of mortgages.
      The merged banks would have assets in excess of 25 billion
  dlrs and be one of the 25 largest banks in the U.S.  Norstar
  operates in most of New York state but not in New York City.
      Lougee said at some point in the future banking operations
  that both Norstar and Fleet operate in the state of Maine would
  be combined.
      The agreement between Norstar and Fleet includes a
  ""lock-up"" option designed to deter other acquirers. Each
  granted the other an option to purchase authorized but unissued
  shares amounting to 24.99 pct of the fully diluted shares
  outstanding.

  &lt;General Partners>, controlled by
  privately-held Wagner and Brown and by AFG Industries Inc, said
  plans to sell GenCorp Inc's aerospace and soft drink bottling
  divisions if it succeeds in acquiring the company.
      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  General Partners said proceeds from the sale of GenCorp's
  aerospace division would help it repay some of the debt it
  would incur in the 100 dlr a share cash tender offer.
      General Partners, which launched the surprise tender offer
  today, said it already 2,180,608 shares of GenCorp, or 9.4 pct
  of the total outstanding common stock.
      General Partners, which estimated the total cost of the
  takeover at 2.5 billion dlrs, also said it plans to continue
  GenCorp's policy of trying to settle Federal Communications
  Commission charges against two of its television and 12 radio
  station licenses.
      It said it would also continue GenCorp's policy of trying
  to sell its New York-area television station WOR to MCA Inc
  &lt;MCA> for 387 mln dlrs and its Los Angeles station KHJ to Walt
  Disney Co &lt;DIS> for 217 mln dlrs.
      But General Partners said it plans to keep GenCorp's
  headquarter in Akron, Ohio.
      General Partners also said it would maintain GenCorp's
  plastics and industrial products division as well as tires and
  related products.
      But it left open that it might make other changes in
  GenCorp's operations after it completes the merger.
      Besides using 250 mln dlrs of its own equity for the tender
  offer, General Partners said it would seek one billion dlrs
  under a secured margin facility from Wells Fargo Bank N.A.
  and other banks. It also said it would seek 1.25 billion dlrs
  from the sale to Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc or its
  affiliates of senior subordinated promissory notes.
      In a March 18 letter to GenCorp Chairman William Reynolds,
  which was included in the SEC filing, General Partners
  officials said they were ""confident of our ability to promptly
  obtain the remaining funding as described in our offer
  materials.""
      ""For this reason, we do not forsee any obstacles to a
  prompt consummation of the transaction,"" General Partners said.
      Shearson is dealer manager of the General Partners offer
  for GenCorp.

3355,1,"FAIRFAX SAYS HIGHER TAX HITS FIRST HALF EARNINGS
  Media group John Fairfax Ltd &lt;FFXA.S>
  said that its flat first half net profit partly reflected the
  impact of changes in the Australian tax system.
      Fairfax earlier reported net earnings edged up 2.3 pct to
  25.94 mln dlrs in the 26 weeks ended December 28 from 25.35 mln
  a year earlier although pre-tax profit rose 9.1 pct to 48.30
  mln from 44.29 mln.
      Net would have risen 10.1 pct but for the increase in
  company tax to 49 pct from 46 and the imposition of the tax on
  fringe benefits, paid by employers and not the recipients, the
  company said in a statement.
      Fairfax also pointed to the cyclical downturn in revenue
  growth in the television industry as another reason for the
  flat first half earnings.
      It said it considered the result satisfactory in view of
  these factors.
      Fairfax said its flagship dailies, The Sydney Morning
  Herald and the Melbourne Age, boosted advertising volume, as
  did the Australian Financial Review, and posted extremely
  satisfactory performances. Magazines also performed strongly.
      But an 8.9 pct rise in television costs outweighed a 4.0
  pct rise in revenue, it said.
      Fairfax said a fall in net interest also contributed to net
  earnings because group borrowings were reduced following the
  receipt of a 96.11 mln dlr capital dividend from &lt;Australian
  Associated Press Pty Ltd> (AAP) after the sale of AAP's ""B""
  shares in Reuters Holdings Plc &lt;RTRS.L>.
      This accounted for the 89.32 mln dlr extraordinary profit.
      Fairfax said it is too early to predict results for the
  full year. Increased borrowings after the recent 320 mln dlr
  acquisition of the HSV-Seven television station in Melbourne
  will hit earnings but networking with the Channel Sevens in
  Sydney and Brisbane will produce some offsetting cost savings.

3377,1,"SWISSAIR REPORTS LOWER PROFIT AND DIVIDEND
  Swissair &lt;SWSZ.Z> reported a 5.8 pct
  drop in 1986 net profit to 64.5 mln Swiss francs and said that,
  in line with its new, flexible dividend policy, it would cut
  its payout to 33 francs per share from 38.
      President Robert Staubli told a news conference that the
  first two months of this year gave hope that 1987 profit would
  at least equal last year's figure, but said much depended on
  outside factors such as fuel prices and the exchange rate.
      The fall was largely due to a 60 mln franc loss on
  Swissair's core flying business last year, against a profit of
  27 mln francs the previous year, he said.
      The net profit figure was reached after receipt of some 68
  mln francs from plane sales, compared with a mere 17 mln francs
  in 1985. Finance Head Martin Juenger said he expected around 20
  mln francs from sales this year, although said much depended on
  the speed with which it decided to sell its DC-10s.
      Gross profit for 1986 reached 340.5 mln francs, with 276
  mln francs subtracted for ordinary depreciation.
      Gross profits for the previous year had been 382.5 mln
  francs, with 314 mln subtracted for depreciation, including 45
  mln francs supplementary depreciation.
      Staubli said the 1986 result, well below predictions made
  this time last year, suffered considerably due to exchange rate
  fluctuations, in particular the strength of the Swiss franc.
      While the negative effects on revenue of the sharp drop in
  the dollar were partially compensated for by cheaper fuel
  prices, there was no such offset for the strength of the franc
  against other European currencies.
      ""Income and profit generated by services to these countries
  shrank by a very substantial margin,"" he said. ""Exchange rate
  trends therefore hit us much more severely than most other
  airlines.""

  billion in the same period of 1985/86.
      However, earnings were satisfactory, it said, without

      Foreign turnover dipped to 1.43 billion marks from 1.45
  billion in the first half of last year, although the export
  quota rose to 83 pct from 79 pct.
      The car sector accounted for 1.51 billion marks of

      Production dropped five pct to 25,876 cars from 27,381.

  from 10,533 units but production of 924 and 944 models was cut
  by 12 pct to 14,754 units from 16,848 and would be cut further,
  the report said.
      Car sales fell four pct to 25.269 units from 26,414 in the

  for all models but demand fell in other markets.
      Domestic sales were 39 pct down at 3,267 units from 5,397,
  while sales abroad rose five pct to 22,002 from 21,017. Share
  of exports in sales rose to 87 pct from 80 pct.
      Investments were reduced to 108 mln marks from 125 mln.
      Earnings were hit by lower sales and by the lower value of
  the dollar and currencies in other important markets.
      Nevertheless, sales and turnover would finish the July 11
  year at a ""high level,"" Porsche said.

  Deutsche Babcock AG
  &lt;DBCG.F> expects profits to rise in the current financial year
  ending September 9 although the earnings level is still
  unsatisfactory, managing board chairman Helmut Wiehn said.
      He told a news conference that business during the year had
  weakened somewhat but was still generally positive.
      Sales during the first five months to February was 1.26
  billion marks, 46.7 pct down from the same 1985/86 period.
  However, he expected turnover for the year to be approximately
  unchanged from the previous year's 5.14 billion marks when
  current orders from major projects are booked.
      Wiehn said incoming orders in the first five months to end-
  February totalled 2.50 billion marks compared with 2.04 billion
  for the same period in 1985/86. They included a 45.8 pct
  increase in domestic orders to 1.57 billion marks.
      Orders in hand for the five months were 16.7 pct higher at
  8.64 billion marks.
      Wiehn added that Babcock was still aiming for a three pct
  yield on turnover. In the year to September 1986 group profits
  totalled 39 mln marks on sales of 5.14 billion against the
  previous year's 32 mln on 5.11 billion marks.
      Parent company turnover was unchanged at 25.6 mln marks.
      Wiehn said Babcock's liquidity had clearly improved in the
  current business year, with financial reserves in the first
  five months rising by 237 mln marks to 831 mln after increasing
  by 408 mln marks to 594 mln in 1985/86.
      He said pre-tax earnings per share for 1985/86, according
  to the DVFA method, were 26.95 marks from 21.40 marks and
  earnings after tax rose to 10 marks from 8.10.
      The company earlier said dividend will be unchanged at
  three marks for ordinary shares and 3.50 marks for preference
  shares.

  compared with 852,000 dlrs, or 33 cts per share, during 1985.
      The company said preliminary estimates of 1986 revenues is
  24.5 mln dlrs, compared with 7,900,000 for 1985.
      The estimated 1986 results are based on 3,207,000 shares
  outstanding, compared to 2,566,000 shares outstanding for 1985.
      R. Steven Lutterbach, chairman, said net income for 1986
  was adversely affected primarily due to lower operating margins
  at the company's Western Environmental subsidiary, and to an
  increase in bad debt reserves.
      Western Environmental was acquired in March 1986.
  Lutterbach explained the company has taken steps to improve
  financial and accounting controls, primarily at Western, which
  were not adequate at the time of acquisition.
      He noted the final results for the fourth quarter will
  depend on the allocation of increased costs between the second
  and fourth quarters.
      Lutterbach said it is possible second quarter results will
  be restated, though final net income for the year will remain
  in the estimated range.
      He added preliminary indications for first quarter 1987

3413,2,"TALKING POINT/VIACOM INTERNATIONAL &lt;VIA>
  A bidding war for Viacom International
  Inc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted a
  management group and other investors against National
  Amusements Inc, a closely held theater operator.
      Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source
  close to the management side insisted that timing was on his
  side. He said if outside directors approve the management
  proposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders
  with proxy material going out late this week. ""It would take 20
  days from the day we mail,"" said the source.
      The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by
  investor Sumner Redstone, would need ""half a year"" to complete
  a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must
  accompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licenses
  and cable television franchises.
      Redstone was not available for comment.
      Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a rare
  situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One
  said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and
  if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to
  the Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win.
      The independent directors of Viacom were called into a
  meeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.
      Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One
  major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. ""We think
  we're at the end now, in terms of bidding,"" said the firm's
  arbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified.
      Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal would
  create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The
  management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5
  billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred
  stock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.
      Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,
  a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a
  value of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock
  stock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity
  interest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated
  the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the
  total package worth 52 dlrs per share.
      Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable
  preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of
  convertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion
  was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.
      Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he
  would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond
  April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The
  plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct
  during May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered
  eight pct interest.
      Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management
  group, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,
  were offering high prices. ""Redstone really wants to own the
  company,"" one said. Another said management seemed to have the
  edge on the timing issue.
      Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares.
      A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what
  the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He
  noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp &lt;FMC>, which
  adopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally
  traded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now
  just over 30 dlrs.
      Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two
  two cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs
  from several acquisitions affected results.
      Shares of Warner Communications Inc &lt;WCI> rose 7/8 to
  31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25
  mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at
  37.50 dlrs.
      Chris Craft Industries &lt;CCN>, which owns a stake in Warner,
  rose 1-1/4 to 22-3/4.
      Viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from CBS Inc &lt;CBS>.
  The company has 940,000 cable television subscribers, operates
  nine satellite television services and owns television and
  radio stations. It is one of the largest distributors of films

  Pillsbury Corp, reporting lower
  earnings for the third quarter ended February 28, said a strong
  performance by its Foods Group was offset by Restaurants Group
  declines.
      Excluding unusual items, it said restaurants operating
  profit was down in the quarter 12 pct from a year ago as sales
  rose four pct.
      It said Burger King USA and Bennigan's reported higher
  operating profit, but profits fell sharply at Steak and Ale,
  which introduced a new menu.
      Pillsbury also reported lower profits at Distron, Burger
  King's distribution arm, and said increased investment spending
  on developing concepts - QuikWok, Bay Street and Key West Grill
  - hurt results.
      It said Foods operating profit, excluding unusual items,
  rose 10 pct with international operations and domestic breads
  and baking products major contributors to improvement in the
  quarter.
      A turnaround in grain merchandising was a major factor in
  profit improvement for the nine months, Pillsbury said.
      Pillsbury said corporate expense showed a 4.3 mln dlr
  profit in the quarter reflecting a 10.5 mln dlr gain on the
  sale of a joint interest in an Australian food company and
  lower corporate expenses, largely as a result of an early
  retirement program initiated a year ago.
      Earlier, Pillsbury reported fourth quarter earnings of 48.5
  mln dlrs, or 56 cts a share, down from 55.4 mln dlrs, or 63 cts
  a share a year ago. Sales advanced to 1.53 billion dlrs from
  1.46 billion dlrs.
      Pillsbury said loss of investment tax credits under the
  1986 Federal Tax Reform Act reduced per-share earnings by nine
  cts in the quarter and 19 cts in the nine months.
      As a result of the act, it said its effective income tax
  rate rose eight points to 48.1 pct in the quarter and 5.5
  percentage points to 49.7 pct for the nine months.

3424,1,"BRITOIL SEES LOWER U.K. EXPLORATION EXPENDITURE
  Britoil Plc's &lt;BTOL.L> exploration
  expenditure for the U.K. In 1987 was likely to be only about a
  third of the level in 1986, though overseas expenditure would
  remain approximately the same, Chief executive David Walker
  said.
      He told reporters following the release of the company's
  1986 figures that project expenditure would also remain at 1986
  levels.
      U.K. Project expenditure in 1986 rose to 208 mln stg from
  184 mln while exploration expenditure dropped to 87 mln from
  156 mln. Overseas exploration fell to 28 mln from 58 mln in
  1985.
      Earlier, Britoil posted a drop in pretax profit for 1986 to
  134 mln stg from 759 mln in 1985, before an extraordinary
  charge of 50 mln stg on the company's U.S. Assets. The results
  were slightly better than analysts forecast and the share
  firmed to 231p from 222p at last night's close. Chairman Sir
  Philip Shelbourne said the collapse in the oil price in 1986
  had made the period extremely difficult but the company had
  come through remarkably well.
      Provided the recovery in oil prices was maintained, the
  conditions would be right for a substantially improved
  performance this year.
      He added that the firmness of oil prices in March, when
  they were normally weaker, made him ""a bit encouraged"" about the
  prospects for future levels.
      Walker added that Britoil would feel confident if the price
  stayed within a band of 15 dlrs to 20 dlrs a barrel.
      Britoil had received some 100 responses to its announcement
  of a desire to sell the assets and was asking for bids by the
  latter part of April.
      End-year reserves rose to 603 mln barrels of oil compared
  with 503 mln previously. However, Walker noted that this
  included a revised definition of reserves.
      If 1985 figures were restated along the same lines, the
  reserve figure would show a drop from 720 mln barrels
  previously.
      Gas reserves also eased to 3,568 billion cubic feet from a
  restated 3,660 billion.

  Solar Systems by Sundance Inc said it
  agreed to buy a 45 pct interest in a company that will sell
  condoms produced by INKEY SA of Spain.
      It said a spermicide used in INKEY's condoms contains an
  ingredient that may help prevent the sexual transmission of
  AIDS. The ingredient was cited in an article in the West German
  publication, Aids Forschung. But it said the article was
  about the ingredient and did not mention the spermicide or the
  condoms made by INKEY.
      The company also said it is changing its name to
  Eurocapital Corp shortly.
      Solar Systems said it was buying the 45 pct stake in a
  U.S.-based &lt;Europharmaceutical Co>. INKEY and an affiliate own
  the remaining shares of the company, which was set up to
  distribute condoms and vaginal products that are made, or are
  being developed by INKEY.
      The agreement calls for a two mln dlr payment to Inkey for
  the distributorship. The first 500,000 dlr payment is due 30
  days after the products are approved by the Food and Drug
  Administration. It said Europharmaceutical plans to soon file
  with the FDA to market the condom, but expects the approval
  process to be a lengthy one.
      The company said the active ingredient in the spermicide is
  currently used in the U.S. in antiseptic applications unrelated
  to condoms. As far as it knows, the ingredient has not been
  tested in a spermicide.
      Inkey's condoms will be sold in the U.S. under the brand
  name, ""Carlton."" The exclusive distribution contract for the
  products runs for three years and is renewable for one-year
  periods, the company said.
      It said the condoms are currently sold in Spain but have
  not gone on sale in other European countries.
      It said Europharmaceutical currently does not have the
  resources to make the payments under the distribution agreement
  or fund the studies necessary to obtain marketing approval from
  the FDA.
      The company also said Europharmaceutical is in talks to
  acquire either one or more publicly held companies with little
  or no assets. In the event an acquisition goes through, Solar
  Systems' interest in Europharmaceutical would be diluted below
  its current 45 pct.

  Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, the
  largest chemical company in the United Kingdom, will expand its
  specialty chemicals and drug businesses this year, and better
  its 1986 results, said chairman-elect Denys Henderson.
      ""We expect to shift our company toward higher value-added
  businesses and continue to broaden our base,"" Henderson told
  reporters at an informal meeting here.
      ICI today announced the formation of a new U.S.
  drug company, ICI Pharma, which, with its Stuart
  Pharmaceuticals unit, it said will double its current
  pharmaceutical sales to 1.1 billion dlrs by 1990.
      Henderson said, ""Our pharmaceutical business gets lost in
  the way that Glaxo's (Glaxo Holdings PLC) does not.""
      ICI's pharmaceutical division is the second largest drug
  maker behind Glaxo in the U.K. Last year U.S. drug sales were
  about 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1.5 billion dlrs,
  which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits.
      He estimated that by 1990, ICI's pharmaceutical division
  would account for about 30 pct of total company profits.
      ""The drug division far and away brings in the highest rate
  of return,"" said A.W. Clements, finance director of ICI, who
  was also at the meeting.
      Henderson said the new U.S. drug concern would basically
  act as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugs
  to doctors. ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one.
      Henderson said the major new products in the company's
  pipeline, expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrs
  annually, were Statil, a treatment for diabetic complications,
  Zoladex, a treatment for advanced prostate cancer, and Carwin,
  a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure.
      Henderson said U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval
  to market Statil and Zoladex, both under joint licensing
  agreements with Merck and Co Inc &lt;MRK>, is not expected until
  about 1989. ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwin
  in the U.S. later this year.
      Henderson said the company's 1987 results would top 1986
  income of 888 mln dlrs or 5.45 dlrs per ADR on sales of 15
  billion dlrs, but he declined to specify by how much.
      Henderson said 1987's results would be boosted by Glidden
  Paints, which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from a
  unit of Hanson Industries Inc.
      Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrs
  available for acquisitions. Last year the company made 40
  acquisitions, the largest being Glidden. He said that more
  acquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out an
  acquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as ""too expensive.""
      Henderson said that in his new role of chairman, effective
  April one when he takes over from Sir John Harvey-Jones who
  will retire, the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing the
  earnings momentum ICI has established over the past few years
  after restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses.

3505,1,"TEXAS COMMERCE &lt;TCB> SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987
  Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc said that
  relatively stable oil prices and the bank's planned merger with
  Chemical New York Corp &lt;CHL> would help 1987 earnings increase
  from last year's profits of 20 mln dlrs.
      Texas Commerce chairman Ben Love, in an interview with
  Reuters, did not elaborate on how much the bank expected
  earnings to increase.
      ""We would anticipate that this year would be an improvement
  over last because we are stronger,"" Love said, referring to
  Texas Commerce's pending 1.19 billion dlr merger with Chemical.
  The merger, which may be finalized as early as May 1, will
  lower Texas Commerce's cost of funding by an estimated 10 to 15
  basis points, Love said.
      The Texas Commerce-Chemical merger is the only acquisition
  by a major out-of-state bank since Texas lawmakers approved
  interstate banking effective January 1.
      Hard-hit by loan losses in energy and real estate in Texas'
  struggling economy, the only major Texas banks able to report
  profits in 1986 were Texas Commerce and RepublicBank which
  earned 54.0 mln dlrs. Allied Bancshares Inc &lt;ALBN> lost 17.6
  mln dlrs, MCorp &lt;M> lost 82.1 mln dlrs, InterFirst lost 326.5
  mln dlrs and First City Bancorporation &lt;FBT>, which is actively
  seeking a merger or other form of new capital, lost 402.0 mln
  dlrs.
      Love said Texas Commerce had turned the corner on its
  energy loan portfolio problems, but added that the bank's
  nonperforming real estate loans may increase during 1987.
      ""I think the tidal wave in energy has passed over us,"" he
  said. ""The fact that the real estate market is still moving
  away suggests there could be some continuing growth of
  nonperforming loans.""
      In 1986, about 42 pct of Texas Commerce's net loan losses
  related to real estate lending and 13 pct was due to energy
  loan losses. That compares to 1985 when only 17 pct of the
  bank's losses were in real estate and energy accounted for 43
  pct.
      More than half of Texas Commerce's nonperforming loans,
  which totaled 968 mln dlrs at yearend 1986, up from 840 mln
  dlrs the year before, were in real estate.
      Love said he believed the real estate loan problems for
  Texas Commerce and other major state banks would peak by the
  third or fourth quarter of 1987. Absorption of empty office
  buildings in Houston, which has a current vacancy rate of about
  30 pct, will be a gradual process that could take up to four
  years, he said.
      ""I think we may be beginning to stabilize this economy. Oil
  at 18 dlrs a barrel brings much more confidence than 10 dlrs a
  barrel,"" he said.
      Texas Commerce will retain its name as a separate
  subsidiary of Chemical and plans to aggressively expand its
  holdings throughout Texas, offering additional products to
  build up its consumer banking business, Love said. ""We are
  resuming what we did best for years -- an offensive position,""
  he said.
      In January, Texas Commerce acquired a failed bank in
  Montgomery County, adjacent to the Houston metropolitan area,
  and earlier this month opened a new bank in San Antonio. Texas
  Commerce plans to add more banks in San Antonio and in the
  Dallas-Fort Worth area where it currently has only 16 member
  banks, he said.
      One day after the Texas Commerce acquisition was announced
  in December, InterFirst Corp &lt;IFC> and RepublicBank Corp &lt;RPT>,
  both headquartered in Dallas, agreed to merge in a deal valued
  at 570 mln dlrs.
      The combination of former archrivals RepublicBank and
  InterFirst, giving the two banks a virtual lock on the Dallas
  banking market, has not changed Texas Commerce's expansion
  plans for the state's second-largest city, Love said. ""We think
  we can try to get a little part of their roost,"" he said.
      The Chemical partnership will also give Texas Commerce an
  edge in developing new consumer products, he said.
      ""We have always been a wholesale bank but we have more than
  one million customers all over the state. Chemical will show us
  how to take advantage of enhancing our consumer products,"" he
  said, referring to expansion of such existing products as
  credit cards and investment banking.

3514,2,"TALKING POINT/AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP>
  American Express Co's plan to sell a
  stake in its Shearson Lehman Brothers is believed to be a
  prelude to a public offering of shares in the brokerage unit,
  analysts said.
      American Express earlier said it has a general
  understanding with Nippon Life Insurance Co of Japan to sell a
  13 pct interest in Shearson for 530 mln dlrs.
      The statement triggered a rise in other brokerage stocks,
  as investors speculated on the possibility of more investment
  in the U.S. brokerage industry by Japanese concerns.
      The stocks of brokerage firms also climbed in response to
  the relatively high value Nippon put on its stake in the U.S.
  firm. Analysts said the 530 mln dlrs for 13 pct represents a
  price of 2.7 times book value.
      Perrin Long of Lipper analytical said the brokerage stocks,
  depressed somewhat by the dark cloud of the U.S. insider
  trading scandal, closed out February at a market value of 1.8
  times book value.
      American Express was trading today at 78-1/4, off 3/8. For
  the last several weeks, the stock has been strong on rumors of
  a spinoff of part of Shearson.
      Analysts said American Express and its Shearson unit will
  benefit from the doors Nippon Life can open to the increasingly
  important Tokyo financial markets.
      ""I think this, in all honesty, is a preliminary step,"" said
  Long.
      ""What you will see probably in the future is American
  Express selling an additional 17 pct in the public market and
  have a public vehicle for Shearson,"" Long said.
      ""Normally, investors do not make a major capital commitment
  into an illiquid situation,"" he said of Nippon.
      Some analysts previously speculated a 20 pct stake in
  Shearson might be sold to the public. They said the firm, like
  other investment banks, needs capital to expand globally.
      American express has said the total employees of shearson
  will expand by 20 pct in 1987 internationally. However, that
  number is substantially lower than growth last year, a company
  spokesman said.
      American Express officials would not comment beyond a
  statement made this morning. That statement, however, did not
  close off the possibility of a public offering or other option
  for Shearson.
      David Anthony, a Smith Barney analyst, said it is possible
  Shearson would be partially sold to the public. But he believes
  the firm will digest the Nippon investment first.
      ""I think they'll figure out what they're going to do with
  the money they have,"" he said.
      Joan Goodman, an analyst with Pershing and Co, also said
  American Express could determine to sell shares to the public.
      In its statement, the financial services giant said it is
  continuing to study various plans for Shearson in addition to
  the investment by Nippon.
      American Express said options under study range from
  expanding Shearson's capacity to meet international competition
  to broadening its access to capital.
      American Express also said the options reflect the
  continuing integral role of Shearson in American Express'
  worldwide financial services strategy.
      Shearson follows Goldman, Sachs and Co in finding a
  Japanese partner. Goldman last year sold a 12.5 pct stake to
  Sumitomo Bank in exchange for a 500 mln dlr capital infusion.
      Analysts speculated there will be more such matches.
      ""Those (U.S. brokers) companies have the expertise. They
  don't have the money. There's just not enough internal capital
  growth,"" said Wertheim analyst James Hanbury, who follows other
  U.S. brokerage companies.
      Hanbury said some Japanese companies, flush with cash, are
  interested in the expertise of American brokers. ""Those
  (Japanese) companies have the capital and our companies have
  the capital needs and the growth opportunities to use the
  money. That's a nice marriage,"" he said.

  Quebec, the government agency which manages the province's
  pension funds, said its investment portfolio earned a net
  profit of almost three billion Canadian dlrs in 1986, an
  increase of 300 mln dlrs over 1985.
      The agency said in its annual statement that it had assets
  with a total book value of 25 billion dlrs, or a market value
  of 28 billion dlrs, at the end of 1986.
      These holdings had a rate of return of 13.5 pct in the
  year, which was below the Caisse's average return of 16 pct in
  the past four years and 14.2 pct in the past eight years.
      The Caisse said foreign equity investments represented 3.6
  pct of total assets, while U.S. government securities accounted
  for another 5.2 pct of the overall portfolio.
      The agency's holding of U.S. government securities yielded
  a return of 20.7 pct for the year, significantly more than
  either the 14.1 pct earned on the total bond portfolio or the
  13.5 pct for all funds under management.
      ""These high liquidity securities, which are held on a
  temporary basis and for purposes of strategy and the protection
  of the overall bond portfolio, have been efficient,"" the agency
  said of the U.S. securities.
      The agency said it has 7.9 billion dlrs invested in
  Canadian private sector businesses after channeling 965 mln
  dlrs of new funds into this area in 1986.
      The Caisse said it acquired 825 mln of new Government of

  Asea Group, the diversified industrial

  earnings, after financial income and expense, to be flat
  compared with 1986, when it earned 2.53 billion Swedish crowns,
  or 371.1 mln dlrs.
      A company spokesman said 1986 results were boosted
  significantly by the booking of two large orders for nuclear
  power plants.
      This gain, he said, will be balanced in 1987 by a return to
  profitability by Asea's power transmission segment, which had a
  loss of 183 mln crowns, or 26.9 mln dlrs, last year.
      Currency conversions were made at 6.81 crowns to the dlr.
      The spokesman said the company has built up a strong
  backlog of orders that will contribute to earnings in 1988 and
  beyond.
      At yearend 1986, Asea's order backlog stood at 32.7 billion
  crowns, or 4.8 billion dlrs, up from 30.9 billion, or 4.5
  billion dlrs, at the end of 1985.

      The company emphasized the first quarter is a traditionally
  slow period for the ferry industry, which is  part of Sea
  Containers' business.
      Sherwoood said the company's losses were largely
  attributable to non-recurring events and provisions. He cited
  the default of 15 container leasees and ship charterers,
  costing the company approximately 25 mln dlrs.
      He also cited a 23 mln dlr cost as a result of a closing

  long-term loans to Brazil as nonperforming.
      But the company stressed in a filing with the Securities
  and Exchange Commission that it believes it is too soon to
  reclassify the debt, despite Brazil's Feb 20 suspension of
  direct interest payments on medium- and long-term loans.
      ""The corporation believes that it is premature to make a
  decsion to classify such medium- and long-term debt as
  nonperforming at this time,"" First Interstate said.
      But First Interstate said that if Brazil's suspension of
  interest payments continues, it may have to reclassify its
  loans as nonperforming and place them on non-accrual, meaning
  that interest previously accrued but not paid would be deducted
  from net income and interest would no longer be accrued.
      Besides its medium- and long-term debt, First Interstate
  said it also has 165 mln dlrs in short-term loans or trade
  lines in Brazil.

3549,2,"PESCH SEES SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT IN AMI &lt;AMI> BID
  Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch said he
  has had discussions with several American Medical International
  Inc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the
  company.
      Pesch said he has discussed his sweetened, 1.91 billion dlr
  takeover bid for American Medical with several large
  shareholders, including the biggest investor, the Bass family
  of Texas. However, the Bass family has not indicated support
  one way or the other for his offer, he said.
      Pesch, in an interview with Reuters, said based on the
  conversations he held with shareholders, he could not guage
  whether he had majority support. He said, however, there is
  support for his offer.
      Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held
  discussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc,
  the only other holder of more than five pct of American Medical
  stock.
      Earlier today, Wedge Group, which has a 5.5 pct stake, 
  said it held discussions with Pesch, American Medical
  management and other American Medical shareholders.
      Wedge, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
  Commission, said it believes a restructuring of American
  Medical and its business would be ""highly desirable and
  appropriate at this time.""
      ""That's the sort of position that I find a large segment of
  shareholders of AMI really share,"" said Pesch.
      Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining his
  takeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, four
  dlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each
  American Medical share. Wedge said it has no plans to join in
  an effort to seek control of American Medical, but it would not
  rule out a future takeover try.
      Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal
  with the Bass family.
      Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch's
  takeover effort and a further sign that there could be some
  shareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical's
  previous rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from
  Pesch.
      American Medical is expected to resist Pesch's latest bid.
  Larry Feinberg, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said a
  management-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out.
      An American Medical spokesman said the company will comment
  on the new Pesch offer by March 10.
      Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor in
  the outcome of the bid for control of American Medical.
      The Bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in American
  Medical, and the company has previously said the investors
  support management's internal plan to improve the company's
  performance. The Bass family would not comment on American
  Medical or Pesch.
      Pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp
  last year, continues to face a credibilty problem on Wall
  Street because of the long time it took to finish the Republic
  acquisition.
      Republic also has substantial debt, and has left wall
  street questioning whether financing can be completed for the
  much larger American Medical takeover proposal.
      Pesch's first offer for American Medical was made without
  an investment banking firm, another cause for concern to Wall
  Street. However, Pesch entered his second offer with
  representation from Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securities
  and Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group.
      ""I don't have any doubt that the current transaction can be
  worked out and completed, provided we get to the point where
  Ami management will sit down and talk in a friendly
  environment,"" Pesch said.
      Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing
  arrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds in
  acquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of American
  Medical management in place.
      He said he plans to combine the company with Republic to
  form an efficient network of hospitals.
      Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could
  be made for American Medical.
      Byron Nimocks of E.F. Hutton Group said improved second
  fiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worth
  about 20 dlrs per share.
      Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the second
  quarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ct
  loss last year.
      Nimocks said Pesch's revised offer is not worth much more
  than the 20 dlrs cash offered previously.
      But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction
  could be completed because of the revised structure of the
  offer. ""I think it's much more doable,"" he said.
      Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaround
  by replacing some members of management and reducing costs.

  The state-owned Krung Thai Bank Ltd

      He said the takeover decision was made this week to stem

  between the two state-owned institutions.
      The minister said some of the existing 30 Sayam Bank
  branches will be merged with their Krung Thai counterparts,
  while others will continue operating but under Krung Thai's
  name.
      Sayam Bank has existed since August 1984 when the Finance
  Ministry took over and re-named the Asia Trust Bank Ltd.
      Sayam president Waree Havanonda told reporters last month
  her bank posted a loss of more than 400 mln baht in 1986. At
  the end of 1985 the bank, with 13.8 billion baht of assets, was
  ranked 12th among Thailand's 16 local commercial banks.
      Waree said Sayam Bank was trying to recall about six to
  seven billion baht of loans extended by its previous private
  management and was taking legal action to collect another four
  to five billion baht of doubtful debts.
      Krung Thai is Thailand's third largest bank.

3585,2,"SWISS BANKER WANTS BOND RATINGS, SHARE DISCLOSURE
  A top Swiss banker called for an
  obligatory, continuous rating for all Swiss franc bonds and
  said he believed anyone buying more than five pct of a company
  should be made to declare their share.
      In comments at a news conference of &lt;Vontobel Holding AG>,
  chairman Hans Vontobel said he believed it was up to the banks'
  own self-regulating bodies, such as the Swiss Admissions Board,
  to take such action before governmental bodies stepped in.
      A decline in the average quality of borrowers on the Swiss
  franc market and a debate on the use of registered shares to
  prevent takeovers have made both major issues among bankers.
      Vontobel noted that many borrowers already came to the
  market with ratings from the major U.S. Agencies, which were
  readily available to professionals through specialised
  information systems.
      ""We should make this classification obligatory and publish
  it in places that are easily accessible to lay people,"" he said.
  The quick changing nature of the financial market meant these
  ratings should also be continually updated, he said.
      Vontobel also noted that recent years had seen companies,
  worried about takeovers, increasingly issuing registered shares
  and participation certificates rather than bearer shares.
      However, both types of issue had a drawback, he said. The
  recent attempt by Jacobs Suchard AG &lt;JACZ.Z> to take over Hero
  Conserven Lenzburg &lt;HERZ.Z> had shown the limits of a 1961
  pledge by the banks not to sell registered shares to someone
  who was not eligible according to the company's statutes.
      Excessive issue of participation certificates, which do not
  carry voting rights, would also be contrary to the principle of
  greater democracy in the new share law before Parliament.
      ""People buying, for example, more than five pct of a
  company's shares should be made to declare their purchase,"" he
  said.

  receiving 509 mln dlrs for the interest.
      The utility said the share of its interest in the 1,205

  investors which leased it back to the company for a period of
  about 29 years at a negotiated lease payment rate.

      Ohio Edison did not detail the lease payments, but it said
  the ""payments will reduce the amount of revenue the company
  will need to cover our investment in Perry, which translates
  into savings for our customers.""
      The utility said it projects the financing could reduce the
  amount of annual revenue needed by about 20 mln dlrs. It plans
  on filing a rate application with the Public Utilities
  Commission of Ohio to recover the Perry costs later this year.
      It said the sale and leaseback was attractive to the

      There had been speculation another offer might be

  price being paid by Hutton and the managers' PC Acquisition Inc
  is fully valued.
      Analysts and some Wall Street sources said they doubted
  another bidder would emerge since Purolator had been for sale
  for sometime before a deal was struck with Hutton Friday.
      Purolator's stock slipped 3/8 today to close at 34-3/4. It
  had been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer on
  Friday. At least one analyst Friday speculated the company
  might fetch 38 to 42 dlrs per share.
      analysts and wall street sources doubted a competitive
  offer would emerge since the company has been for sale for
  sometime before the deal with Hutton was struck Friday.
      Hutton had been in talks with Purolator's adviser, Dillon,
  Read and Co since late December, a Hutton spokesman said.
      Hutton is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of the
  shares. If all shares are tendered, shareholders would receive
  29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and warrants for stock in
  a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the Purolator U.S.
  courier operation. Hutton values the warrants at two to three
  dlrs per share.

  mln dlrs in revenues a year. That compares with 1.1 mln dlrs a
  year for the average Burger King and 800,000 dlrs a year for
  the average Wendy's."" Since it cost about the same to build a
  single store for any one of these chains, he said, ""McDonald's
  can well justify their expansion.""
      Lee expects McDonald's to earn 4.40 dlrs a share in 1986
  and 5.15 dlrs in 1988. Last year it earned 3.72 dlrs a share.

3635,2,"ITALY SETS RULES FOR COMPANY HOLDINGS IN BANKS
  Companies will henceforth be able to own
  stakes in banks, but these should not constitute a ""dominant""
  holding, an Italian government committee ruled.
      The Interministerial Committee on Credit and Savings,
  headed by Treasury Minister Giovanni Goria, said its decision
  reflected the ""need to safeguard the principle of separation
  between banks and non-financial concerns.""
      It did not quantify what might constitute a ""dominant""
  holding.
      The committee also set conditions for the allocation of
  credits by banks to companies or individuals holding stakes in
  them, and stipulates conditions under which the Bank of Italy
  could exercise its powers of control in the case of stakes held
  by banks in companies or other banks.
      Under the ruling, credits given by banks or their
  subsidiaries to groups or individuals holding five pct or more
  of the bank's capital must not exceed defined limits.
      The value of credits given cannot exceed either one-fifth
  of the combined capital and reserves of the bank itself or
  two-fifths of the value of the stake owned in the bank by the
  group or individual concerned.
      Exceptions to these conditions include credits to concerns
  in which the bank itself has a stake and to branches of foreign
  banks. Credits made by foreign companies or banks to
  subsidiaries which have their legal base in Italy will also be
  excluded from the conditions.
      The Bank of Italy will request banks to insert rules in
  their statutes to ensure that companies or individuals holding
  five pct or more of the bank's capital are not given privileged
  treatment with regard to credit allocation and terms.
      With regard to bank holdings in companies, the Bank of
  Italy can exercise supervisory controls when information on a
  bank's consolidated activities show single shareholdings in a
  company or another bank of 25 pct or more, owned directly or
  indirectly.
      Such controls can also be exercised even if the stake held
  is below 25 pct if it can be considered a controlling interest.
      The controls will not be exercised in cases where the value
  of the bank's stake in a concern is below the lesser of two
  predefined limits.
      These limits are set at 15 billion lire or two pct of the
  total assets of the parent company of the shareholding bank.

3643,1,"TALKING POINT/FIRST CITY BANCORPORATION &lt;FBT>
  First City Bancorporation's sale of 54
  mln dlrs in oil loans to Prudential-Bache should significantly
  reduce its energy problems, but the bank's losses are still
  virtually guaranteed to continue, analysts said.
      The package of energy loans was sold at book value, so
  First City did not to show a gain or loss, said bank spokesman
  James Day. He added it was possible First City would sell more
  of the bank's remaining 1.4 billion dlrs in oil-related loans
  to raise cash.
      The loans had been made by First City to oil producers and
  to oilfield service and supply companies. Day said some had
  already been classified as nonperforming, or charged off as a
  loss, but he could not identify how many were included in those
  categories.
      The loans were purchased by Prudential Bache's Energy
  Growth Fund, a limited partnership created last month with 90
  mln dlrs in funding to invest in oil and gas properties.
      First City, the big Texas bank hit hardest by the downturn
  in oil prices, lost a record 402 mln dlrs in fiscal year 1986
  and has said it is seeking a merger partner or some other
  capital assistance. The Houston-based bank's nonperforming
  assets totaled 897.1 mln dlrs at yearend, up from 563.1 mln
  dlrs at the end of 1985
      Analysts have said no buyer is likely to be interested in
  the troubled bank unless government assistance is available.
      ""Their problems are not just limited to energy. They have a
  substantial portfolio in real estate. This sale in and of
  itself won't make the company look better to a potential
  buyer,"" said Ray Archibold, a banking analyst with McCarthy,
  Crisanti and Maffei Inc.
      ""It does reduce the bank's exposure in energy loans and 54
  mln dlrs is a substantial amount,"" Archibold said, ""but the
  deal represents only about four pct of their energy loans.""
      Of First City's total loan portfolio of 9.9 mln dlrs, about
  14 pct or 1.4 billion dlrs were made to energy producers or
  suppliers, analysts said. Its record losses have been caused by
  its past status as one of the nation's top lenders to oil and
  gas producers and suppliers during the boom days of the late
  1970s and early 1980s.
      First City said about half of the loans sold to Prudential
  came from its Energy Finance Co., an entity formed in 1982 to
  loan money to ""more venturesome"" oil borrowers that promised a
  higher potential return. The other half of the loans were from
  First City's lead bank in Houston.
      Chris Kotowski, an analyst with Oppenheimer and Co., said
  the sale of the package of energy loans was the first
  encouraging news from First City in months.
      ""It's not going to solve all of First City's problems but
  it's a good transaction for them. It may be possible for them
  to sell additional loans,"" Kotowski said. ""Prudential can fund
  these things more cheaply than First City and there's an
  incentive to invest in troubled energy companies right now as
  values are depressed""
      In a statement, First City chairman J.A. Elkins said the
  bank's strategy was to reduce the proportion of energy loans to
  total loans. ""This move, which we believe is the first
  transaction of its kind, helps us further, and we were able to
  make it without suffering a loss.""

  recently completed tender offer in which it raised its
  ownership of Cyclops to 56 pct.
      The company said the suit, filed in U.S. District Court for
  the Southern District of Ohio, seeks a temporary restraining
  order and preliminary injunction requiring Dixons, for 10
  business days, to permit any Cyclops shareholder who previously
  tendered and now wishes to withdraw to do so.
      The company said the order and injunction would also
  prohibit Dixons from exercising a ""lockup"" option granted it by
  Cyclops and prohibit Dixons for 10 business days from
  attempting to exercise any control over Cyclops.
      Audio/Video said the suit also requests the court to order
  Cyclops to immediately provide to all potential bidders for
  Cyclops all information given to Dixons.
      Audio/Video and Citicorp &lt;CCI> have been tendering for all
  Cyclops shares in a competing offer at 80.00 dlrs per share but
  said it could raise its bid to 92.50 dlrs under certain
  circumstances.  Dixons offered 90.25 dlrs in its tender.

3655,2,"JAPAN, BRITAIN DISAGREE ON TELECOM MERGER
  Cable and Wireless Plc &lt;CAWL.L> is
  resisting attempts to merge two Japan-based telecommunications
  firms in the hope that overseas political pressure will force a
  change in those plans, a company executive said.
      Cable and Wireless, which holds a 20 pct stake in one of
  the two Japanese firms, is opposed to plans to reduce its share
  to three pct in the merged firm, director of corporate strategy
  Jonathan Solomon told reporters.
      That plan, put forward by a senior member of the powerful
  business organization Keidanren with the tacit backing of the
  Post and Telecommunications Ministry, has caused a storm of
  protest from abroad that Japan is seeking to exclude foreign
  firms from a meaningful position in the market.
      Pacific Telesis Group &lt;PAC.N> of the United States also
  holds a 20 pct stake in one of the newly formed consortia,
  &lt;International Digital Communications Inc> (IDC).
      Solomon said that both British Prime Minister Margaret
  Thatcher and U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz have
  written to the Japanese government about the planned merger.
      A key U.S. Senate committee, Commerce Secretary Malcolm
  Baldrige and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter have also
  expressed opposition to the merger, he said.
      The Post and Telecomunications Ministry reiterated again
  that it sees no need for two competitors to &lt;Kokusai Denshin
  Denwa Co Ltd>, which holds a monopoly on international calls
  from Japan. The ministry has also suggested that foreign
  shareholders not hold managerial positions in the new firm.
      In an attempt to hammer out an agreement, Solomon today met
  Fumio Watanabe, the senior Keidanren officer trying to arrange
  the merger. But the two sides remained deadlocked.
      At stake is C and W's 400 mln dlr project to lay fibre
  optic cables between Japan and Alaska, to form part of its
  global network.
      ""C and W wants to start right away on the project, such as
  application and other procedures,"" said Watanabe, who is also
  chairman of &lt;Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Inc>. The Japanese
  side is saying that the decision on such a plan should be left
  with the new firm, after the merger.
      ""These decisions (on the merger) were made in consideration
  of Japan's economic conditions and legal systems. I told him we
  are not a colony or something,"" said Watanabe.

  American Telephone and Telegraph Co does

      ""It has been the intent to set the dividend at a level so
  that it could be sustained through the ups and downs of the
  business cycle,"" Olson told a meeting of securities analysts.

      Although ATT will maintain its current dividend, Olson said
  the company wants to decrease the percentage of earnings paid
  in dividends by increasing earnings.
      Industry analysts had speculated that ATT might cut its

  its Musicland Group subsidiary. The gain is slightly higher
  than the expected gain the company predicted in February

  reporters' queries.
      ""You will certainly see substantial growth in Allied-Lyons
  in the second half,"" Holden-Brown said following a presentation
  to Toronto securities analysts.
      Holden-Brown declined to say whether second half growth in
  profit before taxes would exceed the 20.7 pct rise reported in
  the first half. Allied-Lyons had first half profit of 148.0 mln
  stg, up from 122.6 mln stg in the prior year.
      Allied-Lyons will also have a full year extraordinary cost
  of slightly more than seven mln stg for defence costs
  associated with Elders IXL Ltd's failed take-over bid for the
  company, Holden-Brown also said.
      But that cost will be more than offset by an extraordinary
  gain of about 60 mln stg on Allied-Lyons' sale of its 24.9 pct
  interest in Australian brewers Castlemaine Toohey, he said.
      ""So with Australians, you win some and you lose some. But
  hopefully you win them all in the end,"" Holden-Brown said.
      Asked if he thought Allied-Lyons is vulnerable to other
  take-over attempts, Holden-Brown replied: ""No, I don't.""
      ""We must never be complacent and we must always be very
  watchful, but I think we would be very expensive,"" he said.
      Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' share price to corporate
  earnings ratio is now comparable with other leading companies
  in the food and beverage industry.
      ""That was not the case two years ago. If the Australians had
  come a little bit earlier, they might have had more luck, I
  think,"" Holden-Brown said.
      Holden-Brown said Allied-Lyons' move to acquire Hiram
  Walker-Gooderham and Worts Ltd in March, 1986 during Elders
  take-over bid for the company was ""100 pct a growth action.""
      ""We knew when we did it that it could be misconstrued, and
  that people almost inevitably would say (the acquisition was)
  defensive, but it never was,"" Holden-Brown told reporters.
      Asked by securities analysts if Allied-Lyons plans a share
  issue in Canada after acquiring a 51 pct interest in Hiram
  Walker, Holden-Brown responded: ""Plan might be too strong a
  word. But I must say I do feel the need for Allied-Lyons to be
  better known in Canada.""

  Bally Manufacturing Corp's proposed
  public offering of 24 pct of its Health and Tennis Corp unit is
  seen as the first step towards the sale of the entire unit,
  analysts said.
      ""In the longer-term horizon, Bally wants to concentrate on
  its gaming businesses,"" said analyst Dennis Forst of Seidler
  Amdec Securities Inc.
      Last week, Bally said it was considering the sale of
  another non-casino unit, its Six Flags amusement park unit,
  which analysts said could fetch about 300 mln dlrs.
      Bally spokesman Bill Peltier said ""the company currently
  has no hard plans to the sell any more of the health club
  company, but in the long term we'll wait and see how the
  offering goes.""
      Once Bally's biggest revenue producer, the health club unit
  had 1986 operating income of 60 mln dlrs on revenues of 456.2
  mln dlrs, 28 pct of Bally's revenues. Analysts estimate the
  unit could be sold for for 300-500 mln dlrs.
      Analysts said Bally's decision to offer shares in the unit
  could be the first step to selling it.
      ""It would seem obvious that an offering would decrease the
  health club unit's debt, increase its cash flow and operating
  income, making it an attractive buy to a third party,"" Steven
  Eisenberg of Bear Stearns said.
      On Monday, Bally said it filed with the Securities and
  Exchange Commission for an initial offering of 24 pct, or 5.8
  mln shares, of the unit's common stock at 13-15 dlrs a share.
     About half the proceeds, 40 mln dlrs, will be used to reduce
  parent Bally Manufacturing's debt which has swelled to 1.6
  billion dlrs due to recent hotel acquisitions and the purchase
  of shares from Donald Trump who had threatened a hostile
  takeover, according to Bally treasurer Paul Johnson.
      Remaining proceeds from the stock offering and from a
  separate offering of 50 mln dlrs of 20-year convertible
  subordinated debt would be used to repay about 75 mln dlrs of
  short term senior bank debt of the health chain unit, a Bally
  spokesperson said.
      Analysts said Bally's health club unit's profits have

3747,1,"BALLY &lt;BLY> SEEN SELLING OFF HEALTH UNIT
  Bally Manufacturing Corp's proposed
  public offering of 24 pct of its Health and Tennis Corp unit is
  seen as the first step towards the sale of the entire unit,
  analysts said.
      ""In the longer-term horizon, Bally wants to concentrate on
  its gaming businesses,"" said analyst Dennis Forst of Seidler
  Amdec Securities Inc.
      Last week, Bally said it was considering the sale of
  another non-casino unit, its Six Flags amusement park unit,
  which analysts said could fetch about 300 mln dlrs.
      Bally spokesman Bill Peltier said ""the company currently
  has no hard plans to the sell any more of the health club
  company, but in the long term we'll wait and see how the
  offering goes.""
      Once Bally's biggest revenue producer, the health club unit
  had 1986 operating income of 60 mln dlrs on revenues of 456.2
  mln dlrs, 28 pct of Bally's revenues. Analysts estimate the
  unit could be sold for for 300-500 mln dlrs.
      Analysts said Bally's decision to offer shares in the unit
  could be the first step to selling it.
      ""It would seem obvious that an offering would decrease the
  health club unit's debt, increase its cash flow and operating
  income, making it an attractive buy to a third party,"" Steven
  Eisenberg of Bear Stearns said.
      On Monday, Bally said it filed with the Securities and
  Exchange Commission for an initial offering of 24 pct, or 5.8
  mln shares, of the unit's common stock at 13-15 dlrs a share.
     About half the proceeds, 40 mln dlrs, will be used to reduce
  parent Bally Manufacturing's debt which has swelled to 1.6
  billion dlrs due to recent hotel acquisitions and the purchase
  of shares from Donald Trump who had threatened a hostile
  takeover, according to Bally treasurer Paul Johnson.
      Remaining proceeds from the stock offering and from a
  separate offering of 50 mln dlrs of 20-year convertible
  subordinated debt would be used to repay about 75 mln dlrs of
  short term senior bank debt of the health chain unit, a Bally
  spokesperson said.
      Analysts said Bally's health club unit's profits have
  remained strong, but are skeptical about the industry's long
  range prospects.
      ""The fitness club industry, over the last 10 years, has
  grown tremendously, but the question is whether its a fad or a

  ICN Pharmaceuticals Inc  has
  about 500 mln dlrs in cash and another 1.50 billion dlrs in
  available credit, which it intends to use to buy a
  pharmaceutical company, Chairman Milan Panic said.
      At the company's annual meeting, he said an acquisition
  could take place in the next 24 months.
      ""The company has nearly two billion dlrs available for
  acquisition today,"" Panic said, adding, ""We are investigating a
  number of companies."" One company being studied could possibly
  be acquired on a friendly basis, he said.
      Panic also said he intends to seek board approval today to
  repurchase up to three mln ICN common shares.
      Discussing the possibility of an acquisition, Panic said
  the such a purchase is necessary because ICN's current
  marketing capability would not be sufficient to support
  distribution of the company's products, given ICN's
  expectations for market growth worldwide.
      ICN's principal product is ribavirin, also known as
  Virazole. The drug is marketed in a number of countries and
  described as a broad-based anti-viral.
      The company has said its possible applications include
  treatment of some types of hepatitis, herpes, influenza,
  childhood diseases and hemorrhagic fevers.
      ICN has been the focus of consirable investor attention in
  recent months because of Virazole, which has undergone clinical
  trials as a possible treatment of some AIDS-related diseases.
      Panic said today he would not discuss the drug with regard
  to AIDS until the Food and Drug Administration completes its
  review of data submitted by the company.
      He said an investigation of the drug being conducted by a
  House Subcommittee is continuing.
      The subcommittee and the FDA have acknowledged they are
  conducting separate investigations to determine whether or not
  ICN witheld data from the FDA on adverse reactions to the drug.
      Virazole is approved for marketing in the U.S. in aerosol
  form as a treatment for an infection that strikes infants,
  called respiratory syncytial virus.

      Due to the provision, it said its revised 1986 net income

  preferred stock dividend requirements, which were not paid in
  either 1986 or 1985.

  and continuation of insurance and retirement benefits if the
  company changes hands and these officers lose their jobs.
      LILCO said none of these contracts will result in

      Lilco said the downward revision in its 1986 earnings is a

  Diversified investment company, &lt;Ariadne
  Australia Ltd>, has offered 3.8 billion pesos for 38 mln shares
  in the Philippine brewing firm &lt;San Miguel>, a Manila newspaper
  reported.
      The Sunday Times quoted a letter sent yesterday to
  President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman, New Zealander
  Bruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent to five pct
  of the nation's yearly budget to buy the shares from the
  government.
      The presidential office and Ariadne representatives in
  Manila were not available for comment on the report.
      The shares are the entire block seized by the government
  from the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) on suspicion that
  the real owner was Eduardo Cojuangco, the former chairman of
  San Miguel and UCPB and a close associate of deposed president
  Ferdinand Marcos.
      The 38 mln shares consist of 24 mln class A stock and 14
  mln class B shares.
      Government officials have said earlier that the more
  valuable class A shares would not be sold to foreigners.
      The offer values each share at 100 pesos -- the price at
  which the Philippine Social Security System suggested it might
  buy eight mln class A shares last week.
      ""Judge's offer of 3.8 billion pesos is about five pct of the
  Philippines' yearly budget,"" Ariadne's Philippine agent Domingo
  Panganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday.
      ""Mr Judge's objective in this investment is to make his
  corporation's management expertise available to San Miguel so
  that the company's assets can be fully utilised.""
      San Miguel, the country's largest brewer, is also one of
  the major manufacturers of grocery lines.
      Panganiban is quoted as saying that San Miguel could tap
  food and liquor distribution lines in Australia, Britain, the
  U.S., New Zealand and Hong Kong through &lt;Barwon Farmlands Ltd>,
  a listed Australian firm in which it has 30 pct equity.
      Ariadne, with about one billion dlrs in assets and turnover

  The Australia based &lt;Ariadne
  Australia Ltd>, plans to set up a branch in the Philippines to
  fulfill a prerequisite for the takeover of the Philippine
  brewing firm, &lt;San Miguel Corp>, a Hong Kong newspaper said.
      The Hong Kong Economic Journal quoted a spokesman of
  Australian stock broker Jacksons Ltd as saying that &lt;Barwon
  Farmlands Ltd>, a listed Australian firm of which Ariadne owns
  a 30 pct stake, is planning a branch in the Philippines.
      He added Jacksons is arranging an offer by Barwon to pay a
  total 3.8 billion pesos in cash for 38 mln San Miguel shares.
      Barwon is offering 100 pesos each for 24 mln class A San
  Miguel shares and 14 mln class B stock. But the Jacksons
  spokesman noted that the more valuable A stock would only be
  sold to Filipinos or companies registered in the Philippines.
      He said Barwon has approached the Philippine government
  which seized the block of shares from the United Coconut
  Planters Bank, which is believed to be linked with the
  country's deposed President Ferdinand Marcos.
      He added he expects a deal to be concluded between Barwon
  and the Philippine Government in 14 days as it is the only
  offer in cash, the newspaper reported.
      Hong Kong Economic Journal also noted stock market rumours
  that &lt;Neptunia Corp>, a Hong Kong registered company which
  controlled by San Miguel's president Andres Soriano, is the
  other party keen on the block of San Miguel shares.
      The Philippine's Commission on Good Government ruled last
  May against a move of Neptunia to acquire 33 mln San Miguel
  shares controlled by the brewery firm's former chairman Eduardo
  Cojuangco, who is also chairman of United Coconut.
      Commissioner Ramon Diaz said at the time the government
  would not allow a subsidiary to buy into a parent firm, adding
  San Miguel could have offered the shares to other parties.
      The Manila newspaper Sunday Times published a letter sent
  yesterday to President Corazon Aquino from Ariadne's chairman,
  New Zealander Bruce Judge, that he was offering cash equivalent
  to five pct of the nation's yearly budget to buy the shares
  from the government.
      ""Judge's offer of 3.8 billion pesos is about five pct of the
  Philippines' yearly budget,"" Ariadne's Philippine agent Domingo
  Panganiban was quoted as telling reporters yesterday.
      Spokesmen of Ariadne, Jacksons and Neptunia were not
  available for comment, nor any officials of the Philippines.
      &lt;San Miguel Brewery Ltd>, a Hong Kong listed company which
  is 69.65 pct held by Neptunia on behalf of San Miguel Corp,

  profit, said it carried seven pct more passengers on domestic
  routes last year, but 11.5 pct fewer passengers on flights from
  North America and Canada.
      Alitalia said the drop in North American traffic had been
  due to a general fall in the numbers of American tourists
  visiting Europe caused by fears of terrorism.
      The airline reported provisional net profit rose to 55
  billion lire from 48 billion in 1985.
      A spokesman said Alitalia was hoping for an increase in
  traffic with the U.S. In 1987.
      It planned to increase the number of flights from Italy to
  New York to 19 per week, to reinstate flights to Boston and to
  re-open the direct Rome-Milan-Los Angeles service.
      The spokesman announced that from March 29, Alitalia would
  be starting a new weekly service to Shanghai.
      For its summer 1987 programme, it would be adding 127 extra
  flights to European destinations -- an increase of 27 pct.

3816,1,"RAFIDAIN BANK'S JORDAN BRANCH RAISES CAPITAL
  The Jordan branch of Iraq's Rafidain Bank
  said it will raise paid-up capital to comply with the country's
  minimum requirement of five mln dinars by drawing on profits
  from its operations in the country.
      Jordan's government asked banks in early 1985 to comply
  with the new capital requirement -- raised from three mln
  dinars -- by the start of 1986.
      Rafidain's Area Manager Adnan Abdul Karim al-Azzawi told
  Reuters the branch had now registered its capital at the higher
  level but did not say how long it would take to pay it in. The
  bank's 1986 balance shows paid-up capital of 3.1 mln dinars.
      Banks in Jordan have generally complied with the higher
  capital requirement except Chase Manhattan which decided
  instead to close its operation, banking sources said.
      Local banks floated shares to raise extra capital, while
  the branches of foreign banks brought in additional cash.
      Banking sources said it appeared that Jordan had made an
  exception in Rafidain's case, allowing it longer to comply.
  They said the gesture refelcted close political ties between
  Jordan and Iraq as well as Baghdad's financial difficulties.
      The Jordan branch saw pre-tax profit rise 80 pct in 1986 to
  550,332 dinars on assets of 12.6 mln dinars.

3819,2,"DART GROUP FLEXIBLE ON SUPERMARKETS &lt;SGL> BID
  &lt;Dart Group Corp> said it told
  Supermarkets General Corp &lt;SGL> it was flexible on the price it
  would pay to acquire the company.
      Dart has said it would offer 41.75 dlrs cash for each SGL
  share if the SGL board recommended the offer to shareholders.
      SGL has termed the 1.62 billion dlr offer unsolicited.
      In a letter to SGL dated March 20, Dart also said it was
  denied confidential information on SGL that would be given to
  other potential bidders.
      SGL officials could not be reached for comment.
      Dart said it was advised that a selling brochure for the
  sale of SGL had been distributed to about 20 potential buyers,
  but not itself. These purchasers would also be given access to
  SGL's books and records and the opportunity to talk with key
  employees.
      ""We suspect that one or more of the 20 are leveraged buyout
  firms,"" said a source close to Dart. Analysts have said SGL
  management may be considering a leveraged buyout.
      Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on a
  friendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate all
  the terms of its offer.
      Dart said SGL representatives said the company has not
  received any other offer.
      It said it requested the confidential information to better
  understand SGL, but was denied this because it refused to sign
  an agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for SGL without
  SGL's approval.
      The agreement would also have limited its ability to buy
  SGL shares, Dart said. It considered those conditions
  unreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly
  transaction, it said.
      Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares.
      Dart said it requested the information before its meeting
  with SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hope
  representatives would reach an agreement.
      It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was told
  there were certain issues important to SGL management and while
  they were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to take
  them into account in putting together its package.
      It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mln
  dlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman, executive vice
  president James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine.
      Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers'
  severance agreements, although there was an implication that
  Lieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of their
  own volition.
      Dart said under their present agreements, none of these
  officers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also,
  Dart said Lieberman, Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6
  mln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management's
  incentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a cost
  of six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the shares
  unless waived by the company's compensation committee.
      Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for top
  management's supplemental retirement plan.
      Dart said another issue was to agree to future severance
  obligations and future salary guarantees for top management,
  estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligations
  under the company's present policy.
      Dart said despite such management payments, it agreed to
  discuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try to
  negotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL.
      Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chain
  and Rickels home centres.
      Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filed
  by an SGL shareholder, seeking to stop SGL from taking such
  actions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence.
      The suit also sought to have directors carry out their
  fiduciary duty.
      Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by an
  unwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue of
  securities to shareholders which make a takeover more
  expensive.

      The Australia-based Barwon, 30 pct owned by New Zealander
  Bruce Judge's Ariadne group, said in a statement released in
  Hong Kong that a formal offer had been made to the Philippines
  government, which holds the shares.
      It said it was confident the offer will be reviewed
  favourably.
      Newspapers in Manila and Hong Kong reported at the weekend
  that an offer had been made.
      Barwon said it was represented by Australian stockbroker
  &lt;Jacksons Ltd>, which forwarded a formal offer to Philippine
  President Corazon Aquino of 100 pesos for each of the 38.1 mln
  A and B shares of San Miguel.
      The Philippine government seized the shares, which
  represent a 31 pct stake in the brewery firm, from the &lt;United
  Coconut Planters Bank>, alleged by the government to be linked
  with the country's deposed President Ferdinand Marcos.
      The Barwon statement said a deal is expected to be
  concluded between Barwon and the Philippines government in 14
  days.
      Barwon also said it made recommendations to the government
  on how it could purchase the class A shares, which can only be
  held by a Philippine national or a firm which is at least 60
  pct held by a member of the country. It did not elaborate.
      The Hong Kong Economical Journal quoted a spokesman of
  Jacksons as saying Barwon plans to set up a branch in the
  Philippines to meet the criteria.

  Woolworths Ltd &lt;WLWA.S> said policy,
  management and financial changes initiated during the 1986/87
  business year should cause profits to reach more acceptable
  levels in 1987/88 end-February 1.
      Net profit reported earlier fell 85.3 pct in the year ended
  February 1.
      Results for the first month of the new year were
  encouraging after a period of uncertain consumer confidence and
  difficult trading conditions, it said in a statement.
      The Big W discount store division and New South Wales
  supermarkets produced very disappointing results, it added.
      Woolworths earlier reported a fall in net profit to 9.27
  mln from 63.20 mln on sales of 5.47 billion against 4.83
  billion. Capital spending for the year was 119 mln dlrs against
  105 mln for the previous year with 50 new stores opened, but
  total sales were below target, Woolworths said.
      The company provided 20 mln dlrs against operating profit
  for the year to cover mark-downs on stock.
      Extraordinary items included a 53 mln dlr profit on the
  sale of properties and investments less a 28 mln provision for
  reorganising the Big W chain.
      Woolworths is unrelated to the U.S. Group F.W. Woolworth
  &lt;Z.N>. It has been the subject of takeover speculation since
  &lt;Industrial Equity Ltd> acquired a 20 pct stake last year.
      New Zealand's diversified investment group &lt;Rainbow Corp

      Safeway put its stake up for tender just in time to take
  advantage of changes in U.S. Tax laws effective from the end of
  December, informed sources said.

3828,2,"BEGHIN-SAY INCREASES CAPITAL TO FINANCE EXPANSION
  French sugar group Beghin-Say, which is
  49.6 pct owned by Italy's Gruppo Ferruzzi, is to raise its
  capital to 703 mln francs from 527 mln through a three-for-one
  issue of shares and investment certificates to finance
  expansion, president Jean-Marc Vernes told analysts.
      For the first stage Beghin-Say will issue some 2.05 mln new
  65 franc shares at 500 francs to increase capital to 660 mln
  francs. The share currently trades at 734 francs. Then 658,000
  new 65 franc investment certificates will be issued at 400
  francs, raising capital to 703 mln francs.
      The capital increase will bring the group around 1.2
  billion francs in new funds to finance its expansion plans.
  These include the possible acquisition of the Corn Products
  maize starch plant at Haubourdin in northern France, Vernes
  said.
      Ferruzzi is one of several groups bidding to buy all of
  Corn Products' installations in Europe. Apart from the French
  plant, these include three factories in each of Italy and West
  Germany, two in Britain and Spain and one in the Netherlands
  and Denmark.
      Corn Products has put a 650 mln dlr price tag on the
  installations, and Beghin-Say estimates that acquisition of the
  Haubourdin plant would cost between 80 and 100 mln dlrs, Vernes
  said.
      If this bid fails, Beghin-Say would consider acquiring and
  developing two other French plants, either in the maize or
  wheat starch sector.
      Beghin-Say is also planning to finance European expansion
  for its Kaysersberg subsidiary, another major reason for its
  capital increase.
      Kaysersberg, which was transformed from a division of
  Beghin-Say into a fully-fledged chemical subsidiary last year,
  has been holding talks with other European companies on
  possible accords, Vernes said. He added the company could be
  introduced onto the Paris Bourse in the near future.

3854,1,"AMERICAN MOTORS &lt;AMO> STATEMENT QUALIFIED
  American Motors Corp said its auditors
  qualified the company's 1986 financial report.
      The report was qualified due to uncertainties surrounding
  the previously announced arbitration award against American
  Motors' former subsidiary, AM General Corp. The award is being
  contested.
      The report was filed today with the Securities and Exchange
  Commission along with a copy of Chrysler Corp's &lt;C> proposal to
  take over American Motors.
      American Motors said earlier than an arbitration award,
  made to Emerson Electric Co &lt;EMR> in February, amounted to 60
  mln dlrs plus legal expenses. American Motors has challenged
  the award.
      The automaker sold the AM General unit to LTV Corp &lt;QLTV>
  in 1983, the same year it was awarded a five-year, 1.2 billion
  dlr procurement contract with the military. LTV and AM General
  last year sought protection under Chapter 11.
      The arbitration proceeding was called after Emerson
  Electric charged AM General violated an agreement covering the
  development of certain components in the contract.
      The components were for the military's ""High Mobility
  Multi-Purpose Wheeled Vehicle"" (HMMWV), American Motors said.
      In selling AM General to LTV, American Motors agreed to
  indemnify LTV against losses incurred by LTV resulting from the
  Emerson Electric claims.
      AMC also said the award has not been confirmed by a court,
  and faces additional legal challenges. It said that, because of
  the LTV and Am General reorganizations, the final amount of a
  confirmed award and the amount of any loss to LTV is uncertain.

  Tonka Corp said it expects

  decline from the record earnings of 3.8 mln dlrs or 57 cts a
  share and revenues of 53.2 mln dlrs.
      The toy manufacturer attributed its anticipated lower
  financial results to an an expected moderate decline in
  shipments of its Pound Puppies product line.
      Tonka also said it expects revenues and earnings to remain
  lower through the 1987 first half compared with 1986 record
  results of 125.4 mln dlrs in revenues and 10.3 mln dlrs in net
  earnings or 1.47 dlrs a share.
      The company said its level of shipments is good despite a
  conservative buying pattern on the part of retailers industry
  wide. Tonka's first quarter shipments will be down somewhat
  from 1986 record levels and gross profit margins will be down
  slightly from a year ago, it said.
      Second half sales are expected to be stronger based on a
  return to a more traditional seasonal shipping pattern in which
  retailers order and stock conservatively early in the year and
  time large shipments for the second half, it said.
      Tonka said that while the pace of order writing is trailing
  last year's, bookings are ""very good"" for orders on several of

3879,1,"BAYERNVEREIN EXPECTS UNCHANGED DIVIDEND FOR 1987
  Bayerische Vereinsbank AG &lt;BVMG.F>
  expects to pay an unchanged dividend of 13 marks on 1987
  earnings but profits will only barely reach last year's record
  levels, management board spokesman Maximilian Hackl said.
      He told the annual news conference that possible credit
  risks, especially those associated with foreign nations, had
  largely been covered. Risk provisions in 1987 were therefore
  unlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986.
      Group bank net profit rose to 275.52 mln marks in 1986 from
  222.73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profit
  increased to 187.63 mln marks from 161.58 mln.
      Hackl said that interest margins in the banking business
  had declined to 2.71 pct last year from 2.78 pct the previous
  year. But in the mortgage sector, the margins had increased
  slightly and stood around 0.7 pct.
      Parent bank commission surplus in the securities business
  had risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986.
      Expenses for personnel had increased 7.5 pct to 782 mln
  marks and others costs had increased 9.4 pct to 272 mln marks.
      The parent bank's 1986 partial operating profit, which
  excludes earnings from trading on its own account, had climbed
  two pct to 671 mln marks.
      The parent bank's balance sheet total rose 5.3 pct to 81.5
  billion marks at end-1986 compared with end-1985, Hackl said.
      It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgage
  business and a 1.1 billion mark increase in banking business.
      The mortgage sector's share in total parent bank business
  volume rose to 46 pct from 45.
      Hackl said that in January and February this year, the
  bank's credit business had not livened up. But despite the
  sharp downturn on German bourses, profits from trading on own
  account had increased in the first two 1987 months compared
  with the same year-ago period. He gave no detailed figures.

3928,2,"TALKING POINT/WENDY'S INTERNATIONAL &lt;WEN>
  Takeover speculation buoyed Wendy's
  International Inc's stock, even after Coca Cola Co took the
  fizz out of market rumors by denying it was an interested
  suitor.
      Wendy's retreated from an earlier high of 13-3/8, and lost
  a point when Coca Cola &lt;KO> said the rumors were untrue.
  However, Wendy's remained up 5/8 at 12-3/8 on volume of more
  than three mln shares.
      Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors, yet they
  said they could not conclude a takeover of the fast food
  restaurant chain was impossible.
      Wendy's declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds.
  Yet, a Wendy's spokesman said the company was aware of a
  Business Week article, which named Coke as a potential suitor
  and which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill.
      Market sources mentioned Anheuser-Busch Inc &lt;BUD> and
  Pepsico Inc &lt;PEP> as alternatives to Coke as acquirers. Neither
  of those companies would comment, nor would the Wendy's
  official.
      ""It doesn't happen every day, every week, every month, but
  its not unusual for us to be linked with those companies,"" said
  Denny Lynch, Wendy's vice president of communications.
      However, Lynch would not comment specifically on the
  current market rumors.
      Even before Coke denied the rumors, analysts had been
  skeptical of a takeover since Atlanta-based Coke has stated it
  views fast food chains as customers and does not want to become
  a competitor to them.
      ""I can't put another name on it,"" said Kidder peabody
  analyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold up
  Wendy's stock. ""It very well could be someone's interested.""
      But Freedman said he doesn't believe now is the right time
  for Wendy's to be sold.
      ""They're obviously having operational difficulties. I've
  always believed at the right price Wendy's would consider (an
  offer), but I can't believe this is the right price at the
  right time,"" Freedman said.
      ""If a transaction takes place, the buyer's going to control
  the situation,"" Freedman said.
      ""I just don't think there's anything going on. I don't
  think it's worth much more than where it is,"" said Joseph Doyle
  of Smith Barney.
      Analysts said Wendy's has suffered largely from the ""burger
  wars"" between itself, McDonald's Corp &lt;MCD> and Pillsbury Co's
  &lt;PSY> Burger King chain. Wendy's, the third largest fast food
  hamburger chain in the U.S., lost about 11 pct in same store
  sales last year, analysts said.
      Wendy's also fumbled when it introduced a high-priced
  breakfast, which it has since withdrawn, analysts said. Some
  analysts said the company should be bringing in new products,
  but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround.
      There are analysts, however, who believe Wendy's may be
  vulnerable to a takeover.
      James Murren of C.J. Lawrence said Wendy's could be worth
  14 to 15 dlrs on a break-up basis. He said the company has
  improved its debt-to-equity ratio and Wendy's owns a high
  percent of its own restaurants - 38 pct of 3,500.
      ""They also have some attractive leaseholds on their
  restaurants,"" Murren said.
      Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year,
  Wendy's real sales, store for store, turned upwards in the
  fourth quarter. ""That was about the first time in seven
  quarters,"" he said.
      Caroline Levy of E.F. Hutton also believes something could

  France's Societe Generale &lt;SGEN.PA> bank,
  which will be sold to the private sector in the second half of
  this year, reported increased profits for last year.
      Societe Generale, one of the three largest state-owned
  banking groups, said in a statement that its parent company
  profit for 1986 totalled 800 mln francs, up 21.2 pct on 1985's
  660 mln profit.
      This was in line with earlier forecasts of profit of
  between 770 and 800 mln francs.
      The bank's parent company gross operating profits were up
  5.4 pct at 21.34 billion francs against 20.24 billion in 1985.
      The increase in the bank's gross operating profits was
  mostly due to a rise in french franc deposits and personal
  loans as well as the development of its financial activities,
  Societe Generale said.
      Parent company net banking earnings last year were also up
  at 13.9 billion francs compared with 13.57 billion in 1985
  while operating costs totalled 7.44 billion francs against 6.67
  billion the previous year.
      Societe Generale President Marc Vienot said in December he

  &lt;CYL>, proposing to drop the group's offer if Dixons would sell

      ""Cyacq's main equity investor appears ready to pull out and

  completing its tender offer for Cyclops. It also said the court
  refused to require Cyclops to provide Cyacq with confidential

3955,1,"IBM &lt;IBM> REBOUND SEEN BY BERNSTEIN ANALYST
  International Business Machines Corp,
  hit by a two-year earnings slump, should begin a come-back by
  the end of 1987 and post strong growth in 1988, analyst Rick
  Martin of Sanford C. Bernstein Co Inc said.
      ""There will be increasing momentum in earnings, albeit not
  until later this year,"" Martin said at a technology conference
  sponsored by the investment firm.
      Martin said the coming rebound reflects new product
  introductions in the mid-range area, rather than any drastic
  improvement in economic growth or U.S. capital spending.
      IBM, whose stock hit a 52-week low of 115-3/4 dlrs in
  mid-January, has come back lately. IBM was trading up 7/8 at
  149-1/2 dlrs.
      Analysts, computer industry executives, and the company
  itself, have highlighted the external economic factors
  hampering IBM's growth.
      But Martin said the product cycle was key to understanding
  the rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies, and
  pointed to Digital Equipment Corp &lt;DEC> to support his view.
  ""By replacing the product line, earnings have soared,"" he said
  of DEC's line of VAX computers.
      In contrast to DEC, IBM faultered with an incompatible
  mid-range product line. A new computer code-named ""Fort Knox""
  was supposed to tie together a number of IBM's mid-range
  systems, but the product never got off the ground, he said.
      Instead, aspects of the computer were integrated into the
  IBM 9370 machine introduced last year, and other aspects should
  be unwrapped by 1988, Martin said. ""The major story will be a
  rebound in its mid-range business.""
      He said sales of IBM's mid-range computers fell about 13
  pct in 1986. But the new products will lead to 5.8 pct growth
  in mid-range computers this year and 30.7 pct growth in 1988.
      High-end computers, primarily the Sierra line, are coming
  to the end of their product life cycle. Although growing 22.5
  pct in the midst of IBM's sharply lower 1986 year, growth will
  drop to 1.5 pct in 1987 and 1.9 pct in 1988, he said.
      By 1988, overall revenue growth should rise to about 16
  pct, against 5.8 pct growth in 1987 and 2.4 pct in 1986, Martin
  said. Last year, IBM earned 4.8 billion dlrs on revenues of
  51.3 billion dlrs.
      Investors asked what this all meant to DEC, whose earnings
  and stock have been propelled by a strong slew of product
  introductions in the mid-range area.
      In response, Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat to
  DEC, nor DEC as a threat to IBM, because both companies were
  catering largely to existing customer bases, rather than
  stealing market share from one another.

3958,1,"BRUNSWICK &lt;BC> SEES HIGHER 1987 FIRST QUARTER
  Brunswick Corp expects 1987 first
  quarter sales to be up ""dramatically"" and profits to ""do well,""
  chairman and president Jack Reichert said after a securities
  analysts meeting.
      He declined to be more specific.
      In the 1986 first quarter, Brunswick reported earnings of
  23.8 mln dlrs or 57 cts a share on sales of 396.7 mln dlrs.
      Reichart noted that results of its two newly-acquired boat
  manufacturing companies will be included in the company's first
  quarter report.
      Brunswick expects its recreation centers to benefit from
  increased attention to the sport of bowling resulting from
  acceptance in the 1988 Summer Olympics of bowling as an
  exhibition sport and as a medal sport in the 1991 Pan American
  Games, he said.
      He said field testing of a new bowling concept involving
  electronic features is being readied for test marketing this
  summer, and if successful, could ""materially benefit""
  operations.
      Brunswick is currently test marketing in California a
  health club facility adjoining a bowling center, he said.
      Turning to its defense operations, Reichert said he expects
  the division to receive significant contracts in the near
  future. At 1986 year end, Brunswick's defense contract backlog
  stood at 425 mln dlrs.
      Frederick Florjancic, vice president-finance, told analysts
  Brunswick was disappointed two credit rating services recently
  downgraded the company's debt which stood at about 665.4 mln
  dlrs at 1986 year end.
      ""We are confident we can service our debt and bring it down
  in the very near term,"" based on strong cash flow from
  Brunswick's expanded boat operations, Florjancic said.
      Shareholders at the company's April 27 annual shareholders
  meeting will be asked to approve an increase in the authorized
  common shares outstanding to 200 mln from 100 mln shares, a

  of Conrac's outstanding shares.
      The offer, to be made through Mark IV Acquisition Corp, a

  Commission and mailed to Conrac shareholders as soon as
  possible.

  Cooper Development Co said it
  revised results for the year ended October 31 to a loss of 61.7
  mln dlrs, or 2.33 dlrs per share, down from the
  previously-reported loss of 12.1 mln dlrs, or 46 cts per share.
      The restatement was made because of change in the method of
  accounting for a combination of several company-controlled
  concerns that resulted in a 53.5 mln dlr charge, Cooper
  Development said.
      Last August Cooper Development combined its Cooper
  Biomedical Inc unit and its Cooper Laboratories subsidiary with
  Technicon Instruments Corp, a company acquired from Revlon Inc
  &lt;REV>, a Cooper spokesman said.
      The spokesman said the transaction was accounted for as an
  acquisition, but the Securities and Exchange Commission took
  issue with the accounting method and said it should be
  accounted for as a reorganization of entities under common
  control.
      This treatment requires that the costs associated with the
  transaction be expanded rather than capitalized as an
  intangible asset, the company said.
      It also said that, since the charged required an expensing
  of previously accrued liabilities, the company will experience
  no resulting material change it its cash flow.

3968,2,"SEC PROBES 1986 TRE &lt;TRE> TAKEOVER ATTEMPT
  The federal Securities and Exchange
  Commission (SEC) is looking for possible securities laws
  violations in connection with an unsuccessful 1986 bid by
  Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman to take over TRE Corp,
  attorneys contacted by SEC investigators said.
      During the takeeover attempt, a unit of Sugarman's Giant
  Group Ltd at one point held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE.
      It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc, a Los
  Angeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on a
  portion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired.
      In addition, a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mln
  dlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert
  Inc with help from Jefferies, and used a portion of the
  proceeds to buy TRE stock.
      Finally, Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly six
  pct of TRE, according to an SEEC filing.
      The attorneys, who asked not to be identified, said the SEC
  was investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TRE
  holdings were working together without disclosing their
  cooperation, as would be required by the federal securities
  laws.
      One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whether
  Sugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of its
  intended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mln
  dlr bond offering.
      A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE, since December a unit
  of Aluminum Co of America, had been contacted by SEC
  investigators and was cooperating with the probe.
      The spokesman added that TRE Chairman Leopold Wyler had
  been interviewed by the SEC probers.
      A Jefferies spokesman said the SEC had asked for
  information a few months ago as part of an informal probe.
      The spokesman said Jefferies had cooperated with the agency
  and had heard nothing more since that time.
      ""To the best of our knowledge, Jefferies is not the target
  of a formal SEC investigation"" in connection with the TRE bid,
  he said.
      A Drexel spokesman acknowledged that his firm had
  underwritten the debt offering for Sugarman but added:
      ""We had nothing to do with TRE.""
      As a matter of policy, the SEC routinely declines to
  comment on its enforcement activities.

  the unit to Nippon Life insurance co for 538 mln dlrs. The
  preferred shares are convertible to the same number of common
  shares following Hart-Scott-Rodino and FDIC approvals.
      American Express said it will maintain 60 pct, or 60 mln of
  the 100 mln shares of Shearson that will be outstanding.
      American Express said it had agreed with Nippon life that
  American Express will hold a minimum of 40 pct of Shearson
  until January, 1999.
     American Express said 7.5 mln Shearson shares would be held
  by certain employees of Shearson and one mln by a Shearson
  stock ownership plan to be formed.
      American Express said it anticipates a registration
  statement for the public offering will be filed with the

3989,1,"SPRINT OPTIMISTIC DESPITE LOSSES
  US Sprint, the 50-50 telephone venture
  of GTE Corp &lt;GTE> and United Telecommunications Inc &lt;UT> set up
  last June, is optimistic despite expecting to report a net loss
  of about 500 mln dlrs this year.
       David M. Holland, president of US Sprint's Dallas-based
  Southwest Division, told Reuters in an interview that he did
  not know what it would report for the first quarter, but agreed
  that for the year the company should have about the same
  results as last year when it lost ""about 500 mln dlrs.""
       He noted the company was slated to spend 2.3 billion dlrs
  over ""two plus years"" to set up its network.
  
      Holland added that Sprint was still paying almost 500 mln
  dlrs a year to American Telephone and Telegraph Co (T) in order
  to lease its lines.
       He said 16,000 miles of its 23,000 mile fiber optic
  telephone line are now ""in the ground,"" and 7,000 miles are
  operable.
       By the end of the year, he said, 90 pct of the company's
  subscribers will be carried on its fiber optic lines (instead
  of leased ATT lines), compared with 60 pct by the end of the
  second quarter.
      Fiber optic lines, which send digital light impulses along
  microscopic glass lines, is quicker, more accurate and more
  economical than traditional copper cables. A fiber optic line
  the diameter of a dime can carry the same amount of information
  as a copper cable 20 feet in diameter.
       ""By the end of the year, we will have the capacity to
  carry 50 pct of all U.S. long distance phone calls,"" Holland
  said.
      He said ATT currently controls about 80 pct of the U.S.
  long distance market, with MCI Communications Corp &lt;MCIC> about
  10 to 12 pct and Sprint five to seven pct.
       Holland said Sprint's rates, which were 50 pct lower than
  ATT when it did not pay to gain access to local telephone
  exchanges, were now about 10 to 12 pct lower now that all the
  companies have equal access. He said the company was cutting
  back its advertising by about 30 pct this year.
       At the same time, he said Sprint had increased its total
  number of customers to four mln from two mln from July 1986 to
  last January.
      ""We've captured the fiber high ground, shown the importance
  of it,"" he said.
       Concerning the deregulation of ATT, Holland said he
  believed ATT ""should be given some flexibility, but should be
  regulated on pricing plans.""
       ""They're so dominant in the market place,"" he said, adding
  that ATT should be deregulated when ""there is true competition
  in the marketplace.""
       ""It takes time to prove ourselves and a lot of money,"" he
  said, adding, ""maybe two to four years out, it's hard to say.""
      Holland said he was not concerned about talk that Sprint's
  two owners might be squabbling or that corporate raiders, such
  as the Belzberg family in Canada, might be putting pressure on
  them to sell off their loss-making Sprint holdings.
       ""They are two excellent partners who have stated time and
  time again their support of US Sprint,"" he said, adding that he
  was ""amazed"" at industry talk that the two companies might be
  arguing. ""There's no evidence of that,"" he said.
       He said Sprint's progress in such areas as revenues,
  number of customers and construction was on track, even ""ahead
  in many areas.""
      Looking beyond the United States, Holland said Sprint
  currently had direct access to 34 countries and aimed to be in
  90 pct of the Free World nations by 1988.
      ""We want to be in every country that ATT serves,"" he said.
      He said Sprint currently does not have access to Mexico but
  was working on it.
       He noted negotiations between Mexico and GTE Sprint, the
  forerunner of US Sprint, had been broken off by the September
  1985 earthquake which had devastated the nation's telephone
  network.

3998,1,"SWIRE SEEN REPORTING 20 PCT RISE IN 1986 PROFIT
  Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HKG> is
  likely to show a more than 20 pct rise in 1986 operating
  profits when it reports results tomorrow, reflecting gains in
  its aviation and property businesses, share analysts said.
      Analysts polled by Reuters estimated after-tax profits from
  operations will be between 1.525 billion and 1.8 billion dlrs
  compared with 1.23 billion in 1985.
      They also said Swire will have an extraordinary gain of
  about 1.38 billion dlrs from the flotation of its Cathay
  Pacific Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HKG> unit last May.
      Swire had an extraordinary gain of 59.1 mln dlrs in 1985.
      Share analysts said Swire will set a 36 cent final dividend
  for its ""A"" shares, making a total of 54 cents, after 47 cents
  adjusted for a two-for-one bonus issue in 1985.
      Aviation and properties together account for 75 pct of the
  company's net asset value and about 85 pct of its net profits,
  analysts said.
      The company's aviation division consists of its majority
  stake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and its 25 pct interest in
  &lt;Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd>, which is also 25 pct
  owned by Cathay.
      Cathay last week reported 1986 profits climbed to 1.23
  billion dlrs from 777 mln in 1985, partly because of lower fuel
  costs and greater traffic.
      Swire's share of Cathay, which stood at 70 pct before the
  flotation, fell to 54.25 pct at the end of last year and has
  since slipped to 50.23 pct.
      Hongkong Aircraft reported this month its 1986 net profits
  rose 29.5 pct to 115.5 mln dlrs.
      Tony Measor, an analyst at Hong Leong Securities Ltd,
  estimates Swire's profits will be 1.525 billion dlrs.
      ""Much depends on properties,"" said Measor. ""And they did a lot
  better in the second half of the year.""
      Estimates of profits from the firm's wholly owned Swire
  Properties Ltd unit range widely from 500 mln dlrs to 700 mln
  compared with 570 mln dlrs in 1985.
      Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrs
  for the first half of 1986, well below 260 mln dlrs for the
  same 1985 period, but analysts said that was due mainly to the
  low level of completion of new residential flats. The firm's
  properties consist mainly of the Taikoo Shing residential
  development and two luxury housing projects.
      Hoare Govett Asia Ltd said the completion of 1,100 flats in
  Taikoo Shing will have yielded profits of 300 mln dlrs in
  second-half 1986.
      During the year property prices continued to rise as more
  people bought real estate, benefiting from low interest rates,
  analysts said.
      ""At the end of last year, flats in Taikoo Shing were selling
  at 1,100 dlrs per square foot, up by about 20 pct from a year
  ago,"" said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.)
  Ltd.
      Swire is developing a large commercial and hotel complex in
  the central business district of Hong Kong but it will not
  provide income until the first stage is completed next year.
      The company also sold three properties and a part interest
  in a proposed hotel development, which should result in
  extraordinary gains of 60 mln dlrs in 1986, according to James
  Capel (Far East) Ltd.
      Swire's trading and manufacturing operations are expected
  to earn 300 mln dlrs, up 22 pct from 1985 but its shipping and
  offshore services are likely to post a small loss of about 10
  mln dlrs because of depressed market conditions.

  Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD.AMS> unit
  &lt;Shell Australia Ltd>, said its net profit fell to 45.79 mln
  dlrs in 1986 from 66.76 mln in 1985.
      Revenue fell to 4.55 billion dlrs from 4.91 billion, in an
  extremely competitive and over-regulated environment, chairman
  and chief executive Kevan Gosper said in a statement. A 26.25
  mln dlr annual dividend would be paid to the parent after a
  very disappointing year.
      ""A return of 2.2 pct on funds employed represents a very
  meagre return ... In an economy suffering from inflation of
  around 10 pct,"" he said.
      Gosper said the results reflected heavy reliance on
  downstream oil and chemicals, poor coal and metal returns and
  the financial burden of the North-West Shelf gas project.
      Duties, royalties and taxes rose to 1.37 billion dlrs
  against 852.72 mln in 1985 and Gosper urged the government to
  move quickly to lift costly and unnecessary regulation.
      ""It is just as important for Australia to maintain a
  financially healthy, technically advanced refining and
  marketing industry as it is to sustain oil exploration and
  production,"" he said.
      ""The Australian oil industry has the experience and the
  capacity to serve the nation and its shareholders well if the
  government would stop putting roadblocks in our way,"" he said.
      Shell invested 500 mln dlrs over the past five years to
  upgrade its oil refining and marketing business, but further
  investment required an appropriate rate of return, he said.
      Exploration and evaluation spending in 1986 fell to 18.77
  mln dlrs from 26.35 mln, while investment in property and plant
  rose to 374.25 mln from 353.94 mln a year earlier.
      Gosper said oil companies would be under intense pressure
  in 1987 because of forecast slow economic growth.

  &lt;TMOC Resources Ltd> told shareholders
  not to accept Santos Ltd's &lt;STOS.S> 4.00 dlr a share takeover
  bid pending advice from Macquarie Hill Samuel Corporate
  Services, its corporate advisor.
      It said in a statement the Santos bid was below the
  underlying value of the shares as assessed by Macquarie Hill
  Samuel at between 4.08 dlrs and 4.72.
      TMOC, formerly the Moonie Oil Co Ltd, said the valuation
  was made in response to an earlier and still current bid of
  2.55 dlrs a share by &lt;Elders Resources Ltd>. Elders Resources
  holds 19.9 pct of TMOC's 62 mln shares.
      TMOC said it did not know Elders Resources' response to the
  bid or that of its other major shareholder the &lt;Australian Gas
  Light Co>. The latter has a 10.5 pct stake in TMOC.
      &lt;Avalon Corp> of the U.S. Has a 17 pct stake in TMOC
  through an option agreement.
      Santos, which is 15 pct owned by Elders Resources,
  yesterday said its bid valued TMOC at 248.5 mln dlrs.
      TMOC said today this was not a premium over the share price
  before the bid and that TMOC had traded at up to 4.06 dlrs a
  share in the last two weeks.
      TMOC said in the statement that the bid was unsolicited and
  that Santos had only a 3.07 pct stake despite paying up to four
  dlrs a share on-market.
      TMOC has oil and gas interests and pipelines which
  complement the operations of Santos, the major Cooper Basin oil
  and gas producer.
      TMOC shares today closed five cents up at 4.15 dlrs on
  turnover of 182,000 shares while Santos, due to release its
  profit result today, rose eight cents to 4.50 dlrs on volume of

"
4009,2,"WILLIAMS HOLDINGS BIDS 542.2 MLN STG FOR NORCROS
  Industrial holding company Williams
  Holdings Plc said it was bidding 542.2 mln stg for the ordinary
  shares of building products and packaging group Norcros Plc.
      The offer would be made on the basis of 29 new Williams
  shares for every 50 in Norcros, or 432.7p a share
      Norcros shares firmed to 410p at 0914 GMT from a close last
  night of 397p.
      A statement by Williams said it was confident of the merits
  of the proposed merger and it had therefore taken care to
  propose from the outset the right terms, including a full cash
  alternative.
      The offer will include a partial convertible alternative
  under which shareholders would receive up to a total of 205.69
  mln new second convertible shares in Williams instead of their
  ordinary share allocations.
      The offer for Norcros preferential shares offers one
  Williams preferential share for each one of Norcros, for a
  value of 130p each and a total of 2.9 mln stg.
      Last week Williams reported that pretax profits for 1986
  rose to 22.9 mln stg from 6.3 mln.
      Speculation about a bid for Norcros had been circulating in
  the market for several months, dealers said. Initially it
  centred on &lt;Bunzl Plc>, which once held a 2.6 pct stake, then
  switched to Williams when it began accumulating shares.
      Earlier this year, Williams suggested holding talks with
  Norcros on a possible merger but was rebuffed by Norcros which
  replied that any benefits that could be achieved could also
  result from normal trading.
      In the six months to end-September, Norcros reported a rise
  in pretax profits to 20.14 mln stg from 18.55 mln on turnover
  that lifted to 311.82 mln from 303.91 mln
      Williams Holdings began expanding from 1982 when it had a
  market capitalisation of around one mln stg. A series of
  acquisitions in the next four years has pushed its
  capitalisation up to around 380 mln.
      The convertible offer would be on the basis of four
  Williams convertibles for every Norcros share, worth 428p a
  share. The cash alternative would offer the equivalent of
  400.2p a share.
      The announcement of the bid pushed Williams share price
  down to 733p from last night's close at 750p.
      Williams said it held a total 850,000 shares in Norcros, or
  0.7 pct, while an associate held a further 1.99 mln or 1.6 pct.
      There was no immediate response from Norcros.

4011,2,"NIPPON LIFE, SHEARSON TIE-UP SEEN SETTING TREND
  Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr
  purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc
  brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers
  are likely to follow, securities analysts said.
      The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses
  is likely to pay off in dollars and international market
  position, they said. ""It's part of a trend towards growing
  capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign
  financial institutions,"" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with
  Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.
      The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described
  by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give
  Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on
  Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its
  assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.
      Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business
  sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.
      The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50
  joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset
  management, market research, and consulting on financing.
      Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the
  world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said.
      The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the
  deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life
  insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.
      The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese
  insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.
  Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks
  and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and
  instruments.
      Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was
  appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's
  board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a
  limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.
      Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and
  problem-plagued banks in 1984. ""But now Japanese are going for
  blue-chip organisations,"" he said.
      ""It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing
  industries,"" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. ""With a
  historically high yen, and historically low interest rates,
  there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.""
      Competition in fund management has grown along with greater
  Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln
  yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17
  to 18 pct, he said.
      To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and
  gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to
  spread to Japan with further deregulation. ""The high regulatory
  environment has delayed (life insurance firms')
  diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products
  in an environment of increasing competition for performance on
  fund management,"" Smithson said.
  

"
4012,1,"SANTOS SAYS PROFITS HIT BY OIL PRICE FALL
  Leading Australian onshore oil and gas
  producer, Santos Ltd &lt;STOS.S>, said its 1986 results were hit
  by sharp reductions in prices for crude oil, condensate and
  liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).
      The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net
  profit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985.
      Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statement
  that increased production, particularly of oil and LPG, along
  with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil
  exploration and development outlays, were helping Santos deal
  with an adverse business climate.
      Santos said it remained financially strong with an
  injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985
  rights issue, and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at the
  end of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier.
      It said it had also made significant progress in repaying
  debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders' funds
  had fallen to 1.01 from 1.54.
      Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bid
  for the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas
  company &lt;TMOC Resources Ltd> -- valuing the target at 248.5 mln
  dlrs.
      Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollar
  denominated and significant currency purchases were made during
  the year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held
  145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments.
      Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program,
  finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oil
  exploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added to
  reserves -- less than depletion during the year.
      Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme
  to double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for
  oil exploration had been boosted 20 pct.
      Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and
  production volumes but with extra oil exploration and
  encouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism.
      But it called on the goverment to continue fostering
  domestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme.
      ""It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when
  exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when
  Australia's oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly,""
  Massy-Green said.

  the basis of 10 warrants for every 150 stg nominal of deferred
  stock already held, to mark the 150th anniversary of the
  company.
      Each warrant will give the right to subscribe for one stg
  nominal of deferred stock at 750p during a specified period in
  the five years starting in 1988.
      P and O deferred shares were last quoted at 629p, down 1p
  since yesterday, after the company reported 1986 pre-tax profit
  of 174.1 mln stg against 125.6 mln for 1985.
      P and O said 1986 produced an acceptable level of growth,
  though ground has to be made up in one or two areas.
      The company has a strong balance sheet and considerable
  flexibility for 1987, it added. P and O will concentrate on
  expanding in its established market sectors.
      Commenting on the recent ferry disaster in the North Sea
  off Zeebrugge, the statement said the precise cause is unknown.
  The company has instituted an immediate investigation and both
  the British and Belgian governments are conducting inquiries.
      The stricken ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise, belongs
  to Townsend Thoresen, which became part of P and O in January.
      P and O is considering listing its shares in Japan and
  other important overseas financial centres, the statement

4019,2,"NIPPON LIFE, SHEARSON TIE-UP SEEN SETTING TREND
  Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr
  purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc
  brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers
  are likely to follow, securities analysts said.
      The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses
  is likely to pay off in dollars and international market
  position, they said. ""It's part of a trend towards growing
  capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign
  financial institutions,"" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with
  Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.
      The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described
  by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give
  Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on
  Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its
  assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.
      Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business
  sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.
      The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50
  joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset
  management, market research, and consulting on financing.
      Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the
  world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said.
      The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the
  deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life
  insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.
      The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese
  insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.
  Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks
  and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and
  instruments.
      Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was
  appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's
  board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a
  limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.
      Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and
  problem-plagued banks in 1984. ""But now Japanese are going for
  blue-chip organisations,"" he said.
      ""It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing
  industries,"" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. ""With a
  historically high yen, and historically low interest rates,
  there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.""
      Competition in fund management has grown along with greater
  Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln
  yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17
  to 18 pct, he said.
      To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and
  gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to
  spread to Japan with further deregulation. ""The high regulatory
  environment has delayed (life insurance firms')
  diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products
  in an environment of increasing competition for performance on
  fund management,"" Smithson said.

      In a newspaper advertisement, the company said the offer

      Ecolab said the offer is conditioned on receipt of at least

  Woolworth Holdings Plc &lt;WLUK.L> which
  earlier announced a 1986 pre-tax profits rise of 42 pct over
  1985, said its prospects for growth were very exciting.
      The profit figure of 115.3 mln stg exceeded a forecast by
  some 10 pct made during the hostile bid by Dixons Group Plc
  &lt;DXNS.L> last year and the company said the results were a
  major step towards the aim of making Woolworth the most
  profitable retailing group in the U.K.
      It aimed to produce growth from all its businesses and look
  for opportunities to acquire specialist retail businesses.
      Earlier this month the group said that tentative merger
  talks with the high street pharmacist &lt;Underwoods Plc> had been
  called off and recently announced a 19.2 mln stg recommended
  offer for &lt;Charlie Browns Car Part Centres Plc>.
      The B and Q Do it Yourself centres raised sales by 31 pct
  and retail profit by 37 pct, with its pretax contribution of
  45.5 mln making it the largest single component.
      The company said that the improvement had been achieved by
  substantial organic growth in existing stores as well as by the
  opening of a further 29 new outlets and enhanced margins.
      In other sectors, the Comet electrical chain raised retail
  profits by 46 pct to 17.4 mln stg, while the Woolworth chain
  reported a 120 pct improvement to 38.7 mln.
      The company said its property operations would increase
  substantially following the start of a joint venture deal with
  developers &lt;Rosehaugh Plc>.
      The defence costs against the 1.9 billion stg bid from
  Dixons resulted in a 16.0 mln stg extraordinary charge.
      The results were 10 mln stg up on most analysts forecasts.
  As a result, the group's shares rose strongly, peaking at 865p
  from last night's 842p before easing to 860p at 1155 GMT.

  &lt;AB Catena>, in which AB Volvo

  two-for-five stock issue that will raise the company's equity
  capital to 420 mln crowns from 300 mln.
      Catena reported profits after financial income and costs up
  to only 231 mln crowns from 207 mln in 1985, despite an
  increase in sales to 8.54 billion crowns from 5.59 billion in
  1985.
      The company said that its 1986 performance was best
  reflected by earnings after writeoffs, which rose to 310 mln
  from 221 mln in 1985.
      Catena's increase in sales was mainly due to the takeover
  of Safveans AB in February 1986, which changed the business
  profile of Catena. It had principally operated as a Volvo
  dealer. With the Safveans acquisition it is now mainly a
  trading and industrial company.
      In December 1986 Catena sold its share in the stockbroking
  firm Jacobson och Ponsbach Fondkommission AB. This yielded a
  profit of 386.7 mln crowns and was reflected in Catena's
  pre-tax earnings which rose to 724 mln crowns from 204 mln in

"
4075,1,"LOWER TAX OFFSETS LOWER SHELL U.K. UPSTREAM PROFIT
  &lt;Shell U.K. Ltd's> pre-tax profit on
  exploration and production operations fell to 869 mln stg in
  1986 from 2.12 billion in 1985 due to the fall in oil prices
  last year, Shell U.K. Finance director Nigel Haslam said.
      But he told a press conference that due to the high
  marginal tax rate on North Sea operations, the main impact of
  the drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330
  mln stg from 1.45 billion in 1985.
      The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax, with
  Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) representing only 16 mln stg, he
  said.
      As a result, post-tax profit from the exploration and
  production sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln.
      Earlier, Shell U.K., a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell
  Group &lt;RD.AS>, reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg,
  up from 667 mln in 1985, on sales of 6.57 billion stg against
  8.81 mln.
      Shell U.K. Chairman Bob Reid said the company's crude oil
  output from the North Sea was at a record 373,000 bpd in 1986,
  which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for the
  company. Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in the
  current year to around 340,000 bpd, due mainly to the decline
  in output from the major Brent field, he said.
      Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gas
  liquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to
  be maintained in 1987, he said.
      A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and Osprey
  North Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months,
  Reid said. The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5
  billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil
  price fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg.
      Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North
  Sea fields, which were approved last year, have brought the
  cost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget.
      Day to day operating costs of the exploration and
  production sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the target
  is to keep costs per barrel constant.
      The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading to
  the discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early to
  gauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said.
      Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a
  profit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985.
      Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit &lt;Shell
  U.K. Oil>, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987
  were a ""bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986.""
      In November and December in particular, refining operations
  had shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil
  product prices, he said. He expected margins to continue
  generally positive over the summer, although they could dip to
  become negative from time to time, depending on price
  movements.
      A new catalytic cracker at Shell's Stanlow refinery will
  now come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988, about five
  months behind schedule, following a crane accident which
  severely damaged the plant last year, he said.
      Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from
  11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemical
  site.
      Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief, by which
  companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying
  development expenditure on certain future oil fields against
  PRT, was ""helpful,"" but rather less than had been hoped for.
      Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in
  the range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that, he
  would expect some over-production above OPEC""s official 15.8 mln
  bpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down.
      He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrain
  output was holding, bringing supply and demand into balance,
  but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil will
  fall.

      The venture expects to bring into production a
  gold-silver-lead-zinc ore body on Admiralty Island, Alaska,
  containing about 3,500,000 short tons of ore assaying about
  0.18 ounce of gold, 24.0 ounces of silver, 9.7 pct zinc and 3.9

  significant potential for the discovery of additional ore.
      Hecla said initial production from a trackless underground
  mine is scheduled for late 1988 at a rate of about 1,000 tons
  or ore per day.  ""At this rate, the Greens Creek mine will be
  the largest domestic silver mine and is expected to be one of

  &lt;Prudential Corporation Plc>, which
  earlier announced a 62 pct rise in 1986 pre-tax profits, said
  it had recorded its best general insurance result for six years
  but had not reached satisfactory levels of profit in other
  areas.
      Group Chief Executive Brian Corby told a news conference
  that despite returning to trading profits, the International
  division and the Mercantile and General division had not
  reached satisfactory levels.
      But he said he welcomed Mercantile and General trading
  profits in 1986 and was optimistic about both that and the
  International division.
      The acquisition of the U.S. Life company &lt;Jackson National>
  had a small effect in 1986 but its full effect would be felt in
  the 1987 results, Corby said.
      The Group also intended to expand the number of its estate
  agency firms bought last year, and hoped they will comprise
  between 10 and 15 pct of total company profits in the future.
      ""We hope they will be very profitable very shortly. We are
  looking for profits from the estate agencies themselves as well
  as the insurance products associated with them,"" Corby said.

      The company said the remainder of its write-off would
  include a one-time expense for future costs related to early
  retirement programs, office consolidations and an increase in
  the general reserve for adjustments and contingencies.
      Bruce Wilkinson, president of the company, said the charges
  to the company's third quarter earnings, for the period ending
  March 31, would ""significantly impact"" third quarter results
  but would not affect the company's cash position.
      ""We expect to have the biggest operating backlog in the

  Standard Chartered Plc &lt;STCH.L>, faced
  with a recession in the key Singapore and Malaysian markets and
  an ongoing depression in the shipping industry, boosted its
  bad-debt provisions in 1986, chairman Lord Barber said.
      Barber said in a statement on the bank's 1986 results that
  bad and doubtful debt provisions, both general and specific,
  stood at 545.6 mln stg against 416.6 mln at end-1985.
      Bank figures showed the increase was almost exclusively in
  the specific bad risk provision, which qualifies for U.K. Tax
  breaks. New specific provisions rose by 111.5 mln stg while
  71.2 mln stg were reallocated from the general risk provision.
      In all, a 184.2 mln stg charge was made against profits for
  1986, compared with a 100.7 mln stg charge in 1985. Total
  pre-tax profits fell to 254 mln after 268 mln in 1985.
      ""The continuing serious recessionary conditions in Singapore
  and Malaysia and the depressed condition of the shipping
  industry made it necessary to provide heavily against bad and
  doubtful debs arising from loans in the Asia Pacific region, on
  top of the normal level of provisioning,"" Barber said.
      He said, ""the decision was also taken to build up loan loss
  reeserves by making a sizeable increase in the charges for
  general provisions for commercial and cross border risks.""
      Barber said due to bad-debt provisioning, the Asia Pacific
  region made ""a negligible contribution to pre-tax profits.""
      He said the profits contribution from the U.K. Businesses
  was ""well maintained, although the reported result was affected
  by cross border debt provisioning,"" while Californian subsidiary
  Union Bank ""showed continued growth.""
      ""Tropical Africa, Middle East and South Asia all turned in
  excellent performances and the revival in Europe continued,"" he
  said.
      Barber said the group, which succesfully fought off a
  takeover bid by Lloyds Bank &lt;LLOY.L> last year, strengthened
  its capital resources during that year to just over three
  billion stg, while total assets increased to 32.2 billion.
      Capital adequacy ratios remained strong, with the primary
  capital ratio standing at 7.5 pct at end 1986, he said.

4120,2,"CYACQ CUTS CONDITIONS ON CYCLOPS &lt;CYL> BID
  Cyacq Corp, an investor group bidding
  for Cyclops Corp, said it amended its outstanding 92.50 dlrs a
  share tender offer for Cyclops to eliminate two conditions and
  modify a third one.
      The group, which includes Audio/Video Affiliates Inc and a
  unit of Citicorp &lt;CCI>, said it also obtained additional
  financing commitments, including an increased commitment from
  Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd.
      The conditions that were eliminated are Cyacq's request for
  non-public information about Cyclops that was previously
  provided to Dixons Group PLC and Cyacq's being satisified that
  the information provides an adequate basis for Cyclop's
  published financial projections.
      Cyclops has agreed to be acquired Dixons Group, which has a
  90.25 dlrs a share tender offer for Cyclops outstanding. Dixons
  said earlier it would allow the offer to expire tonight.
      The condition that was modified, which required Cyacq to be
  satisfied that break up fees or other obligations to Dixons
  were rescinded or ineffective, now says Cyclops shall not have
  paid any such fees or expenses to Dixons prior to the
  consummation of Cyacq's offer.
      Cyacq's amended offer expires midnight New York time on
  April three, 1987, unless extended.
      Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co and CIT Group/Business
  Credit Inc increased its tender offer commitment to 197 mln
  dlrs from 166 mln dlrs and its merger commitment to 275 mln
  dlrs from 250 mln dlrs.
      Additionally, the Citicorp unit and Audio/Video have
  increased their commitments to Cyacq to 185 mln dlrs. Of the
  new total, 150 mln dlrs has been committed by Citicorp.
      Cyacq said it estimates that it needs 407.5 mln dlrs to buy
  all Cyclops shares that may be tendered and pay related fees
  and expenses.
      It said it is seeking to arrange the balance of about 25.5
  mln dlrs necessary to complete the offer.
      All previously announced conditions regarding the lending
  group led by Manufacturers Hanover remain in effect, except
  that the loans are subject to the concurrent receipt by Cyacq
  of equity contributions and other financing of not less than
  210.5 mln dlrs for the tender offer facility and 213.5 mln dlrs
  for the merger facility.
      Cyacq also said the Citicorp unit had received no
  indications of interest in an alternative offer it had made
  from Dixons, Cyclops or Alleghany Corp &lt;Y>, which has agreed to
  acquire Cyclops' industrial group from Dixons.
      Under the alternative offer, the Citicorp unit, with
  Cyacq's approval, proposed to acquire the industrial group from
  Dixons.

4122,1,"KODAK &lt;EK> TO CUT POLYESTER FIBER OPERATIONS
  Eastman Kodak Co said it will
  reduce capacity and employment levels in two polyester fiber
  operations of its Eastman Chemicals division.
      A company spokesman said the company will take ""some
  writeoff"" in connection with the action in the first quarter
  and there will probably be a further ""carryover"" writeoff in
  the second quarter.  The writeoffs will cover the costs of
  plants and equipment involved, as well as expenses connected
  with the staff cuts.
      Kodak said the division will discontinue production of
  polyester partially-oriented filament yarn, or POY, at its
  Carolina Eastman Co plant in Columbia, S.C., and will idle 100
  mln pounds of older polyester staple fiber production capacity,
  mostly in Columbia.
      The company said about 350 jobs will be affected in
  Columbia, most of which are now performed by contract workers,
  and about 225 jobs at its Tennessee Eastman Co plant in
  Kingsport, Tenn.
      Kodak said part of the staff reduction will be achieved
  through an enhanced voluntary separation and retirement plan
  for employees of Carolina Eastman, Eastman Chemical Products
  Inc and other Kodak units in Kingsport, except Holsten Defense
  Corp. Most of the workforce reduction is expected to be
  completed by April 30.
      Kodak said depressed prices and poor financial performance
  have led to the decision. It said about 50 mln pounds of POY
  production will be shut down as a result of its exit from the
  business. All Kodak POY production has been at Carolina Eastman
  since last year.
      The company said annual capacity for production of Kodel
  polyester staple fiber will be reduced to 400 mln pounds from
  500 mln due to lesser demand.
      It said it will proceed with a previous decision to phase
  in a new 100 mln pound staple fiber plant at Carolina Eastman.
      Carolina Eastman employs about 1,350 and the Kingsport
  units affected about 10,800.
      The company spokesman later said the charges will be
  insignificant and will have no impact on earnings estimates.

4123,2,"CONRAC &lt;CAX> SOARS FOLLOWING MARK IV &lt;IV> BID
  Heavy buying by speculators boosted
  Conrac Corp 7-7/8 to 29, higher than a 25-dlr-per-share cash
  tender offer announced by Mark IV Industries Inc &lt;IV>.
      ""It's a case of ChemLawn euphoria,"" said one arbitrageur,
  referring to a recent hostile tender that began at 27 dlrs per
  share and ended when ChemLawn Corp &lt;CHEM> found a white knight
  willing to bid 36.50 dlrs.
      For Conrac, the arbitrageur said, 28 dlrs per share seemed
  like an ""appropriate price."" Another said ""it's too early to
  project the outcome.""
      ""The market is speaking for itself and saying the 25 dlr
  offer is inadequate,"" the second arbitrageur said. But he added
  it was hard to make a case for Conrac being worth much more
  than the 29 dlrs where the shares traded today.
      He noted the stock recently sold in the high teens and
  there could be a downward risk of 10 dlrs or more if Conrac is
  able to thwart Mark IV.
      Conrac urged shareholders to take no action while its board
  studies the offer and confers with advisers. Conrac said it
  would make a recommendation by April 17.
      A third arbitrageur noted Mark IV had been involved in
  several takeovers previously and has proven itself to be a
  determined bidder. ""They're not beginners,"" he said.
      Another said Conrac might have trouble if it tried to find
  another buyer. ""It's a hodge-podge of non-related businesses,""
  he said. ""There is only a small universe of people who would
  want to own the company as it's presently structured.""
      Conrac is involved in video displays, computer software,
  aircraft instruments, telephone answering machines, welding
  equipment and other products.
      ""I'm telling retail clients to sell and leave the rest for
  those who can take the risk,"" said Rudolph Hokanson, analyst at
  Milwaukee Co.
      He called the 25-dlr offer by Mark IV ""fair value but on
  the low side."" ""I don't think management was looking for a
  buyer in any way before this offer,"" he said.
      Hokanson said Conrac has conservative finances and has
  developed a reputation for quality products that serve niche
  markets. He said management has done a good job of turning
  around the telephone answering machine business.

4130,1,"PDVSA INCOME ON OIL SALES FELL 45 PCT IN 1986
  The state oil company Petroeleos de
  Venezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income from
  oil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal by
  almost 100,000 barrels a day, Minister of Energy and Mines
  Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said.
      Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annual
  assembly, Hernandez said PDVSA's income from oil sales had
  dropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986, down 45 pct from last
  year's 13.3 billion.
      Fiscal revenue from oil sales, which was estimated at 66
  billion bolivares for 1986, totalled 43.5 billion, a drop of 34
  pct which Hernandez said ""had a very serious impact on
  Venezuela.""
      PDVSA's export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day, of
  which 658,000 bpd were crude oil and 850,000 bpd refined
  products.
      The figure surpassed PDVSA's stated goal of 1.410 mln bpd
  and the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd. But it was not
  enough to cover the losses from a drop in the average price
  from 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year.
      The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higher
  than the figure originally announced by the Central Bank.
  Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accounting
  system which included the results of PDVSA's overseas refining
  and marketing operations.
      Consumption in Venezuela's internal market increased from
  323,000 bpd in 1985 to 342,000 bpd last year. However,
  Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keep
  gasoline sales almost constant at 164,000 bpd.
      Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrels
  in reserves of light and medium crudes, shifting the balance of
  Venezuela's reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country's
  production capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd, of
  which 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes, Hernandez said.
       Venezuela's total proven reserves as of December 31, 1986
  were 55.521 billion barrels, the fourth largest amount in the
  world, Hernandez said.

4135,1,"IMPERIAL OIL &lt;IMO.A> TO FOCUS ON HIGHER PROFIT
  Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct owned by Exxon
  Corp &lt;XON>, will focus on maintaining its financial strength
  and improving near-term earnings performance through operating
  expense reductions and selective capital spending, the company
  said in the annual report.
      Imperial Oil said it expects to spend about 750 mln dlrs on
  capital and exploration expenditures in 1987, compared to 648
  mln dlrs in 1986 and 1.16 billion dlrs in 1985.
      Imperial previously reported 1986 operating net profit fell
  to 440 mln dlrs or 2.69 dlrs share from 694 mln dlrs or 4.27
  dlrs share in the prior year.
      Imperial Oil said the attention to earnings results from
  the desire to pursue longer term growth opportunities should
  the investment climate improve and the belief that low or
  volatile crude oil prices could continue during the next
  several years.
      The company also said actions initiated during 1986 to
  restructure and improve efficiency should continue to show
  benefits in 1987.
      During 1986, the company cut operating, administrative and
  marketing expenses by 91 mln dlrs and reduced the number of
  workers by 16 pct to 12,500.
      Imperial chairman Arden Haynes said in the annual report
  that it is too early to determine whether the recent upward
  movement in international oil prices will be sustained.
      ""It is still a time for prudence and caution, and the
  company's actions will continue to be based on the fundamentals
  of market supply and demand,"" he said.
      Haynes said prospects for the company's petroleum products
  division are more promising than before, but are still
  uncertain. Imperial's 1986 petroleum earnings rose to 174 mln
  dlrs from 102 mln dlrs in 1985.
      Haynes said more satisfactory product margins on its
  petroleum products could result if demand recovers as it has in
  the United States.
      The company's chemicals business outlook is mixed, Haynes
  said. Prospects for growth in petrochemical sales is good as
  long as economic growth continues, but future large grain
  surpluses could dampen fertilizer demand and maintain pressure
  on prices.
      Imperial's chemical business earned 17 mln dlrs in 1986,
  compared to three mln dlrs in 1985.

  Resorts International Inc
  said it received a proposal from &lt;KSZ Co Inc> under which
  holders of Resorts class B stock would receive 140 dlrs a share
  in cash and one share of common stock in a new company to be
  formed through the takeover.
      Under the offer, Resorts said holders of its class A shares
  would receive 15 dlrs a share in cash and three shares of
  common stock in the new company.
      Resorts said the offer from KSZ calls for a merger of
  Resorts with RI Acquisition Co Inc, a newly formed Delaware
  corporation.
      Resorts said that prior to the merger, RI Acquisition would
  be capitalized with about 100 mln dlrs of debt and about 220
  mln dlrs of equity.
      It said 200 mln dlrs of the equity would be in the form of
  special preferred stock.
      The KSZ offer, Resorts said, indicates that KSZ has a
  commitment from &lt;M. Davies Cos> to buy all of the special
  preferred stock.
      Resorts said the offer will expire at 1700 EST on March 27.
  It said it asked its investment advisor, Bear, Stearns and Co,
  to advise its board on the offer.
      Earlier this month, the estate of James M. Crosby and
  certian members of his family agreed to sell their class B
  shares to New York real estate tycoon Donald Trump for 135 dlrs
  a share. The estate and family members hold 78 pct of the
  752,297 class B shares outstanding.
      Trump also agreed to pay 135 dlrs a share for the remaining
  class B shares outstanding.
      Resorts also has about 5,680,000 shares of outstanding
  class A stock. These shares carry one one-hundredth the voting
  power of the class B shares.
      Trump's offer beat out a rival bid of 135 dlrs a share made
  by Pratt Hotel Corp &lt;PRAT>.
      Resorts said that under the proposal made by KSZ, existing
  class A and class B shareholders would control about 96 pct of
  the outstanding common of the new company formed to acquire
  Resorts.
      Resorts said the new company, upon completion of the
  merger, would hold the 220 mln dlrs of debt and that the
  special preferred stock would immediately be converted into
  exchangeable participating preferred of the new company.
      This preferred, Resorts said, would pay a dividend based on
  the net cash flows from the new company's Paradise Island
  operations.
      A Resorts spokesman said the KSZ offer was made in a
  two-page letter and that Resorts could not comment on it
  because it did not contain enough information. Resorts has
  asked Bear, Sterns to obtain complete data, he said.
      The spokesman said Resorts is not familiar with KSZ but
  that it believes the company is controlled by Marvin Davis, the
  Denver oilman.
      Calls to Davis were referred to Lee Solters, who handles
  public relations for Davis. Solters, said to be travelling, was
  not immediately available for comment.
      Donald Trump was also unavailable for comment, as was a
  spokesman for the Crosby estate.

  of Citicorp's individual banking division.

  out other developing areas, such as U.S. mortgage and

  California Microwave Inc said
  it will take non-recurring charges of 9.7 mln dlrs to pre-tax
  earnings in the third quarter ended March 31.
      The company said earnings from operations in the second

  to be in the break-even range.
      In the second half of 1986 net earnings were 2,297,000

      The company said the charges relate to its
  telecommunications products area and three other areas.
      California Microwave previously estimated the write-downs
  in the six to eight-mln-dlr range. It said it will add to that
  a reserve for investment losses in Argo Communications Corp.
      Also to be included in the write-down are charges against
  its advances to an Arizona-based communications electronics
  firm the company has an option to acquire, it said.
      In addition, accruals are being made for costs associated
  with the company's reduction in its Sunnyvale work force.

  Borg-Warner.
      In late February, an investor group headed by Jacobs

  Borg-Warner.
      Borg-Warner said it advised Jacobs that before its board
  would give Minstar access to company records Minstar would have
  to provide satisfactory evidence that sufficient financing was
  committed to carry out whatever transaction was proposed.
      A Borg-Warner spokesperson said the discussions with Jacobs
  and other Minstar officials focused on terms and conditions
  under which the company would consider granting Minstar access
  to the information it was seeking.
      The Borg-Warner spokesperson said the company has not been

      Earlier today GenCorp said it will not ask shareholders to

  the election of a staggered board of directors and the
  elimination of cumulative voting.
      However, the group said it will continue to try to block
  GenCorp's poison-pill provision.
      The group, a partnership of AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> and

  GenCorp for having the three proposals voted on by shareholders
  at its annual meeting.
      GenCorp said it withdrew the proposals so that it could

4196,2,"MERGERS, PUBLIC OFFERS SEEN AMONG CAR DEALERS
  Automobile dealerships have become
  large, multi-store operations, and the largest sell more than 1
  billion dlrs a year worth of vehicles a year.
      Around the auto industry there is talk of mergers and
  buyouts among dealerships, and there are rumors that the
  largest are considering offering shares to the public, analysts
  say.
      Retail car sales ""are at a point of transition. There's not
  much that's off the table in terms of creative thinking"" about
  ways to sell cars, says David Cole, analyst with the University
  of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute.
      The retail car market is ""much more freeform now"" than it
  was in 1956, the year things began to change, says Detroit
  analyst Arvid Jauppi of Arvid Jauppi and Associates.
      Thirty years ago, in 1956, the situation was different.
  Dealerships sold one kind of car--a ""Chevy"" or a Ford or a
  Studebaker. The average dealer had 17 employees and sold
  738,000 dlrs worth of vehicles, according to the National
  Automobile Dealers Association.
      That year a tiny car from overseas--Germany's Volkswagen
  Beatle--began to gain popularity. The ""Bug"" caused ""a
  rebellion"" among dealers, who demanded greater freedom from
  restrictions placed on them by the major American automakers,
  says Jauppi.
      One of the most visible changes in retail car sales has
  been in the size of dealerships, auto analysts say. Last year,
  the average dealership had 11.2 mln dlrs in sales--a 15-fold
  increase from 1956--and employed 34 workers.
      ""I had one of these guys tell me he makes six, seven mln
  dlrs a year and didn't know what to do with all his money,""
  says Cole.
      ""There's a whole lot more rich guys who sell cars than that
  make cars,"" he says.
      With the increase in size, large dealers have been buying
  up other dealerships, and auto analysts see few signs the trend
  will let up.
      Donald Keithley, vice president, dealer services, for J.D.
  Power, a California-based market research firm, says that, by
  1990, 12,000 people will own dealerships compared to 16,800
  principal owners today.
      Many dealers are experimenting with owning several
  franchises, some of which might compete against each other. ""It
  used to be a Chevrolet dealer was a Chevrolet dealer. Now a
  Chevrolet dealer might handle several lines,"" Jauppi says.
      As dealers get bigger, industry officials are talking about
  the possibility that some of them might become publicly-owned
  or open international operations.
      Offering shares to the public is an option large dealers,
  ""are obviously thinking of very seriously,"" says Cole.
      Although some say the franchise system might get in the way
  of a public offering, Jauppi says there are few obstacles to
  trading in car dealer shares.
      ""Dealers are large enough now to go public. The only thing
  the manufacturer cares about is that the dealer sells those
  cars. It could happen any time,"" Jauppi says.
      ""If you look at the whole merger mania, and look at the
  scale some of these dealers, it's going to be very hard to
  resist taking them public,"" said another analyst.
      And Jauppi says that dealerships can be expected to become
  international.
      ""We're going to have international dealers--dealer networks
  that are worldwide,"" he says. U.S. dealers will be attracted
  particularly to Europe, where the market will expand faster
  than the U.S., he says.
      ""It's not totally off the wall,"" says Cole.

  Chapman Energy INc said it is launching

      Under the plan, Chapman will exchange securities and cash
  for all outstanding 12 pct senior subordinated debentures due
  2000 and will sell a controlling interest to Troon Partners
  Ltd.
     The agreement with Troon requires Troon to advance 6.5 mln
  dlrs partially secured by a first mortgage lien on the
  company's interest in its natural gas pipeline partnership and
  Troon to tender 100,000 principal amount of debentures to
  Chapman.
      Proceeds of the loan will be used for the cash portion of
  the restructuring. Troon will acquire a majority stock interest
  and control of the board.
      In addition, Chapman and Troon will establish a 10 mln dlrs
  acquisition joint ventures, it said.
      The plan also contemplates establishing a restructured loan
  providing for one master credit agreement having an aggregate
  balance of 22.4 mln dlrs.
      The plan also contemplates the recapitalization of
  preferred stock whereby each share will be converted into three
  shares of common stock.
      Chapman also said it also plans to negotiate settelment and
  discharge of a substantial portion of its accounts payable and
  settlement of certain litigation.
      If approved by various creditors and shareholders, the
  company expects the plan to be completed by May 29.
      Chapman also repoted a loss of 43.4 mln dlrs for the year,
  including asset writedowns of 35.5 mln dlrs, compared to
  December 31, compared to a net income of 177,243 in 1985.
      The 1986 loss resulted in shareholders' deficiency of 15

4205,1,"JARDINE MATHESON PROFITS SEEN UP SHARPLY IN 1986
  A strong performance by its retail
  businesses and affiliates will enable Jardine Matheson Holdings
  Ltd &lt;JARD.HKG> to report on Friday a big leap in net profit in
  1986, stock analysts said.
      They told Reuters they expect the firm to show earnings of
  between 420 mln and 450 mln H.K. Dlrs last year against 157 mln
  in 1985.
      The analysts also said they expect Jardine Matheson to pay
  a total dividend of 15 to 20 cents a share against 10 cents a
  share in 1985.
      James Capel (Far East) Ltd estimates Jardine Matheson's
  1986 profits at 450 mln dlrs and attributes most of the income
  to retail sales.
      Analysts said the group's 7-Eleven retail stores and its
  franchises, among them Canon cameras, Christian Dior luxury
  goods and Mercedes Benz cars, produced a strong cash flow.
      Alan Hargreaves of Hoare Govett Asia Ltd also put Jardine
  Matheson's 1986 net profits at 450 mln dlrs and said he
  estimates pre-tax earnings from retail operations at about 465
  mln dlrs against 339 mln in 1985.
      But Hargreaves said Jardine Matheson's earnings from its 35
  pct stake in Hong Kong Land Co Ltd &lt;HKLD.HKG> will fall to
  about 230 mln dlrs from 281 mln dlrs in 1985.
      The reduced contribution reflects the spin-off from Hong
  Kong Land of &lt;Dairy Farm International Ltd> last September.
      Jardine gained a direct holding of 35 pct of Dairy Farm as
  a result of the spin-off. Analysts said Jardine will book
  revenues from its Dairy Farm stake for the final months of the
  year as part of its retail business, which will increase its
  overall retail income figures.
      Analysts said Jardine Matheson will also enjoy sharply
  increased revenues from financial services, mainly its 50 pct
  share of &lt;Jardine Fleming Holdings Ltd>.
      Jardine Fleming yesterday reported record profits for 1986
  of 209.5 mln dlrs against 104.7 mln in 1985.
      Analysts said Jardine Matheson made net interest payments
  of about 200 mln dlrs last year, slightly below the 213 mln
  dlrs of 1985, while the company's term debt remained at about
  the 1985 level of 2.7 billion dlrs.
      But Jardine was also subject to increased taxes of 340 mln
  dlrs last year against 292 mln in 1985, they said.
      Jardine Matheson is undergoing a series of reorganisations
  that will in effect turn it into a holding company for its
  diverse interests.
      It previously announced a plan to sell its stakes in both
  Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm to newly created &lt;Jardine
  Strategic Holdings Ltd> in which it has a 41 pct interest.
      A company statement issued last month said the firm will
  use the proceeds to repay all debt, leaving it with an
  additional 500 mln dlrs in cash on hand.
      Though Jardine Matheson will be deprived of a direct stake
  in the high-yield Hong Kong Land and Dairy Farm units, it is
  likely to develop its own business, analysts said.
      ""The future of the stock will depend on the firm's ability
  to creatively structure some new acquisitions,"" said Hargreaves
  of Hoare Govett.
      He noted the firm has suggested financial services as a key
  sector, and he said it may add some insurance firms to its
  existing business.

4206,1,"CHINA'S FIRST JOINT VENTURE BANK REPORTS PROFIT
  China's first joint venture bank, Xiamen
  International Bank (XIB), reported a group net profit of about
  14 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986, the bank's first full year of
  operation.
      General manager Liu Shuxun declined to give a 1987 profit
  forecast, saying targets were under study.
      Assistant general manager Wang Hongshan said the group's
  outstanding loans at end-1986 totalled 620 mln Hong Kong dlrs,
  up from 530 mln at end-1985. Deposits and interbank borrowings
  rose to 680 mln dlrs from 550 mln, he told Reuters.
      Liu said most of the group's profit came from the parent
  company rather than its two wholly-owned subsidiaries &lt;Xiamen
  International Finance Co Ltd> in Hong Kong and &lt;Luso
  International Bank Ltd> in Macao.
      The joint venture bank began operating in September 1985
  but did not officially open until March 1986.
      Liu said the share in the joint venture of the foreign
  partner, Hong Kong-listed &lt;Panin Holdings Ltd>, had been cut
  last year to 49 pct from 60 pct. This was done because foreign
  banks felt the XIB's reputation would be improved if the three
  Chinese partners collectively held a majority stake, he said.
      Liu said news reports about problems concerning Panin were
  unfounded, but he did not elaborate. Panin Holdings reported a
  loss of 1.99 mln Hong Kong dlrs in 1986 after a net profit of
  268,000 dlrs in 1985.
      The Chinese partners are Industrial and Commercial Bank of
  China, Fujian branch, whose share rose to 23.5 pct from 15,
  Fujian Investment and Enterprise Corporation 17.5 pct (15) and
  Xiamen Construction and Development Corporation 10 pct (10).
      One foreign banker said Xiamen International Bank faced the
  same problems as foreign bank branches in trying to compete on
  unequal terms with state-owned banks.
      The foreign banking market in Xiamen is thin and almost
  saturated, he added.
      Officials of the joint venture bank said they benefitted
  from contacts made through its three Chinese partners. But the
  foreign banker, who asked not to be named, said it faced
  internal competition from the Industrial and Commercial Bank.
      Apart from Xiamen International Bank and the International
  Agricultural Development Bank planned by the World Bank and the
  state-owned Agricultural Bank of China, Xiamen has eight
  foreign bank branches or representative offices, mostly of Hong
  Kong or overseas Chinese banks.

      When CPC announced the agreement yesterday in New York, it
  said only that the price would be in excess of 600 mln dlrs.
      Ferruzzi said the deal is subject to agreement on several
  clauses of the contract and needs government authorisations.
      It said the deal would involve 13 starch factories
  employing about 5,000 people in eight European Community
  countries plus facilities and commercial operations in other EC
  states.
      The factories have a capacity to produce the equivalent of
  1.6 mln tonnes of starch in starch and by-products a year, or
  about one third of EC production, from about 2.7 mln tonnes of
  cereals.
      Ferruzzi said the acquisition of these assets would extend
  its presence in the European agro-industrial industry both
  geographically and in terms of products.
      It said it is already the principal EC producer of sugar
  and of soya oil and cake, and the major cereal trader.
      It noted that EC output of isoglucose is subject to maximum
  quotas, of which CPC currently holds a 25 pct share, and said
  it foresaw an increase in other industrial uses of starch in
  the future, notably in the production of ethanol for fuel.
      Raul Gardini, president of the Ferruzzi Group, said the
  present management of the CPC milling business will be asked to
  remain in their posts.

4218,1,"BAT SEES STRONG PERFORMANCE FROM ALL SECTORS
  A strong performance from all BAT
  Industries Plc's &lt;BTI.L> major sectors enabled the group's 1986
  pretax profits to pass the one billion stg level for the third
  year running, Chairman Patrick Sheehy said in a statement.
      The group earlier reported a 19 pct rise in profits to 1.39
  billion, which Sheehy said was achieved without any help from
  exchange rate fluctuations or acquisitions.
      Good results were achieved by its Argos and Saks Fifth
  Avenue in retailing and by Wiggins Teape and Appleton in paper.
      Tobacco accounted for about 50 pct of profit with a four
  pct gain to 764 mln stg and a two pct increase in world volume.
      The results were largely in line with analysts expectations
  and BAT shares firmed by two pence to 537p at 0955 GMT.
      BAT said the U.S. Brown and Williamson unit held most of
  its 1985 gains and increased profit 18 pct in dollar terms.
      Financial services saw profits double to 282 mln with both
  Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar achieving further growth.
      Allied Dunbar reported a 51 pct rise in life annual
  premiums to 39 mln stg. BAT said it increased new business by
  38 pct in the last nine months after a relatively slow first
  quarter. Its permanent health insurance was now the market
  leader and its Unit Trust group was now the second largest in
  the U.K.
      Eagle Star general premiums rose 32 pct to 1.03 billion.
  Its life activities also grew 39 pct with better underwriting
  results in the second half.
      Cash flow was strong and the gross debt to equity ratio
  dropped to 41 pct from 51 pct. The net ratio, at 26 pct, left
  the group strongly placed to pursue its further development.
      Profits from paper and pulp grew 29 pct to 217 mln stg,
  nearly three times the 1982 level, with Wiggins Teape's sales
  rising 36 pct to pass one billion stg.
      BAT said in 1986 it had sold 88 BATUS stores in the U.S.
  For 644 mln dlrs and sold Grovewood Securities for 142 mln stg.

  Kloeckner &amp; Co KGaA, the
  international trading group, said its 1986 domestic group net
  profit fell by around 20 pct against 1985, adding that the
  profit resulted largely from a writing back of reserves.
      The company, which gave no 1986 profit figures, posted a
  domestic group net profit of 41 mln marks in 1985.
      It said the 1986 profit was made possible through a 40 mln
  mark write-back of reserves that had been created to cover
  possible price rises. These reserves were no longer necessary
  because of recent declines in raw material prices.
      Kloeckner attributed the profit decline to the fall in
  prices as well as the lower value of the dollar.
      It said it would pay an unchanged dividend on its ordinary
  share capital, which is entirely in private hands and held
  largely by family foundations.
      Kloeckner's nominal 100 mark profit-participation
  certificates, issued in October 1986, will pay a likely yield
  of around 10 pct. Holders of the certificates are entitled to a
  quarter of the 1986 payment, or around 2.50 marks, the company

"
4224,1,"SWIRE EXPECTS CONTINUED GROWTH THIS YEAR
  Swire Pacific Ltd &lt;SWPC.HKG> expects
  continued growth in all divisions this year though it sees
  problems in the marine sector, chairman Michael Miles said.
      He told reporters:""1987 has started well for Cathay Pacific
  Airways which looks forward to another good year... Swire
  Properties expects further good results both from properties
  under development for sale and from its investment property
  portfolio.""
      He did not give any specific projections for earnings. The
  company earlier reported 46 pct higher 1986 net profits at 1.78
  billion H.K. Dlrs from a year ago.
      Swire also had an extraordinary profit of 1.38 billion dlrs
  mainly from the sale of a 15.25 pct interest in Cathay Pacific
  Airways Ltd &lt;CAPH.HKG>.
      Miles said the company will use the money to develop its
  business, primarily in Hong Kong.
      Swire's stake in Cathay was first reduced to 54.25 pct from
  70 pct when Cathay was publicly floated, and then cut to 50.25
  pct when Cathay issued new shares amounting to 12 pct of the
  enlarged capital to the state-owned &lt;China International Trust
  and Investment Corp>. Cathay last week reported its 1986
  profits rose to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln a year ago.
      Miles said despite last year's rapid expansion in Cathay's
  flights and fleet, load factor is still holding up at 70 pct.
      He said Cathay's growth last year was the result of ""a
  marginal increase in the revenue load factor coupled with
  savings in fuel costs.""
      ""At present fuel prices are stable and will remain stable
  for the rest of this year,"" he said, ""though there might be a bit
  of increase later this year.''
      Miles said Swire is not abandoning its offshore oil service
  operations, even though the marine sector is generally
  depressed. ""Obviously the marine industry is not getting any
  better,"" he said.
      The real estate market remained strong and Swire last year
  revalued its property portfolio up 634 mln dlrs compared with
  an increase of 864.4 mln dlrs the previous year.
      Miles said he expects the property market to remain firm
  but said the firm has no available land for a major housing
  project such as its Taikoo Shing development on Hong Kong
  island now near completion.
      He said the company's 50 pct unit &lt;Hongkong United Dockyard

  an existing petroleum storage depot into a major housing
  estate. ""But it's not as big as Taikoo Shing,"" he said.

4225,1,"COMALCO SAYS LOWER COSTS HELPED RETURN TO PROFITS
  Comalco Ltd &lt;CMAC.S> said its return
  to profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium
  prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture.
      It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the
  year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was
  also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and
  greater sales of bauxite and aluminium.
      Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per
  share final, dividend delayed until July 1 to take advantage of
  proposed dividend imputation laws.
      This would make five cents for the year against a first and
  final of one cent in 1985.
      Comalco said the aluminium industry continued to suffer
  from low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australian
  dollar had helped earnings.
      Withdrawal from the &lt;Showa Aluminium Industries KK> joint
  venture had been recapitalised in expansion by the &lt;New Zealand
  Aluminium Smelters Ltd> project with Japan's &lt;Sumitomo
  Aluminium Smelting Co Ltd>, permitting repayments and increases
  in liquid funds totalling 165 mln dlrs, it said.
      As previously reported Comalco's &lt;Commonwealth Aluminium
  Corp> unit has conditionally agreed to sell its smelter at
  Goldendale, Washington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregon
  to &lt;Columbia Aluminium Corp>.
      Comalco said it had made a 27.3 mln dlr extraordinary
  provision for Goldendale losses and closure costs but that if
  the sales agreement were completed it would reduce the
  provision made in the 1986 accounts.
      The other items in the total extraordinary loss of 140.5
  mln dlrs were a 102.9 mln write-off of unrealised exchange
  losses and 10.3 mln for an increase in future tax provision.

4227,1,"CRA EXPECTS TO PAY FINAL DIVIDEND OF 10 CENTS
  CRA Ltd &lt;CRAA.S> said it expected to
  pay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share
  after July 1, making 13 cents forthe year against 15 in 1985.
      The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net
  earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, against
  analysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to160 mln.
      CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until
  later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation
  to its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-free
  to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the
  full 49 pct company tax rate has been pid.
      The company operates on a substituted tax year, not the
  fiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax at
  the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement.
      Consequently, it has funds available for distribution with
  dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation
  legislation before determining the final payout, it said.
      Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a poor
  year for the minerals industry, with the notable exception of
  gold producers.
      Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollars
  declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said.
      Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility
  and uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading to
  substantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said.
      World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories have
  steadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance,
  but overcapacity continues, CRA said.
      Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA said
  Bougainville Copper Ltd &lt;BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrs
  while its share of Comalco Ltd's &lt;CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln.
      Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrs
  against 149.2 mln in 1985, it said.
      Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operations
  incurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in
  1985, CRA said.
      Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs
  against 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln
  from 2.8 mln.
      CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project
  amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985.
      CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinary
  loss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange
  losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard.
      Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for
  closures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase in
  future tax provisions, CRA said.
      Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrs
  before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. The
  strong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights
  issue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debt
  to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs.
      CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985
  mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0
  mln dlrs after tax, included in the net interest cost.

      The original bid was worth about 1.62 billion dlrs.
      Dart said the preferred stock in the new bid would be
  exchangeable for a new class of Supermarkets General debt
  securities that would be developed by Dart and Supermarkets.
      The new proposal would be subject to approval by the
  Supermarkets General board, it said.  The new bid was contained
  in a letter to the Supermarkets General board.
      In Woodbridge, N.J., Supermarkets General -- responding to
  a previous letter to its board by Dart -- said ""Your conduct
  indicates to us that no transaction involving trust and
  confidence can be entered into with you.  Your propaganda and
  missstatements will not panic our board.""
      Dart, in its previous letter, had alleged that Supermarkets
  General executives were seeking millions of dollar in severance
  and tax payments from Dart.

      First quarter 1987 results include one month contribution
  of West Virginia Power, which became a division on March 1,
  1987, Green said in remarks prepared for delivery to analysts.
      Higher earnings for the period reflected reduced operating
  and maintenenace expenses and about 10 mln dlrs in rate
  increases in Iowa, Minnesota, Kansas and Colorado, he said.
      However, Utilicorp's Missouri Public Service division is
  experiencing the effect of a 5.9 pct rate reduction authorized
  in September 1986, he noted.
      Of Utilicorp's total revenues expected for the 1987 first
  quarter, about 43 mln dlrs will be derived from electric
  operations and about 147 mln dlrs will come from gas
  operations, he said.
      Operating income derived from electric operations in the
  first three months of 1987 is estimated to be eight mln dlrs,
  while the contribution from gas operations will be about 10 mln
  dlrs, Green said.
      Green told analysts that Utilicorp received regulatory
  approval from various states and the Federal Energy Regulatory
  Commission to reincorporate in Delaware, effective April one.
      Utilicorp signed an agreement with Cominco Ltd of Vancouver
  to extend the deadline to May 31, 1987, for completion of the
  company's purchase of West Kootenay Power and Light of British
  Columbia, due to a longer than expected regulatory approval
  process, he said.
      Hearings were completed in February and a decision by the
  British Columbia Utilities Commission on the 60 mln dlrs
  purchase by Utilicorp is pending, he said.

  also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and

4313,1,"BAT SHARES UNDERVALUED, SAY STOCK MARKET ANALYSTS
  BAT Industries Plc &lt;BTI.L> 1986 results,
  which were at the upper end of market expectations, showed the
  company was in a strong position and that its shares were
  probably undervalued, share analysts said.
      BAT shares were down at 524p in late afternoon trading
  after a previous 535p close. They touched a high of 538p
  earlier on news of a 19 pct rise in annual profits to 1.39
  billion pre-tax.
      Stock market analysts said today's generally weak stock
  market plus unwinding of positions after heavy buying of BAT
  shares in the run-up to the results caused the fall in the
  share price.
      ""In the current market, people almost expect companies to
  beat expectations,"" said one analyst, adding that pretax profits
  of 1.35 to 1.40 billion stg had been forecast.
      BAT's 1986 figure of 1.39 billion stg compared with a 1985
  pretax profit of 1.17 billion.
      Brokers noted that BAT's shift away from its
  underperforming industries and the decreasing share of the
  tobacco portion of the group were seen as good signs.
      BAT Chairman Patrick Sheehy told a news conference that the
  tobacco sector of the company had declined to 50 pct from 74
  pct four years ago.
      Sheehy said he could see the tobacco portion of the company
  declining further as other sectors increased in importance.
      He said BAT was looking to expand in the area of financial
  services, in particular in the U.S.
      Sheehy also said the group had ""no sizeable acquisitions"" in
  sight in the near future.
      Analysts said BAT's increasingly good performance in the
  U.K. Insurance area was encouraging.
      Its declining debt-to-equity ratio of currently about 16
  pct also made it likely that BAT would soon be looking to make
  major acquisitions, they said.

      Todd said the 75 ct preferred dividend will be paid May one

      The company last paid a common dividend of 44.5 cts a share

      The company has faced regulatory challenges to rates
  proposed to cover the cost of its Grand Gulf nuclear plant.

      Combustion said the restructuring at Lummus Crest is
  expected to substantially reduce but not eliminate this year
  losses in the Engineering and Construction segment.
      But it said improvement at Lummus Crest is expected to be
  approximately offset by a number of factors, including a
  somewhat lower level of earnings in the Power Generation

  acquisition, costs associated with integrating AccuRay

      Cyclops said the moves followed the announcement earlier

      Dixons initially ended its 90.25 dlr a share tender offer

      However, the Securities and Exchange Commission last Friday
  pressed Dixons to reopen the offer because the U.K.-based

  stock be tendered by the close of the offer.
      Dixons then extended the offer until yesterday and earlier

  or just over 20 pct of the roughly 4.26 mln Cyclops shares
  outstanding.

  &lt;John Labatt Ltd> anticipates a good
  fourth quarter and a new peak in sales and earnings for the
  fiscal year ending April 30, president Peter Widdrington told
  financial analysts.
      He would not make any specific forecast, but said he was
  optimistic for further growth in fiscal 1988 in the company's
  brewing and food products operations.
      Labatt's earnings rose to 92.8 mln dlrs in the nine months
  ended January 31 from year-earlier 78 mln dlrs. Revenue for the
  nine months rose to 3.20 billion dlrs from 2.70 billion dlrs.
      Widdrington said Labatt's three-year business plan, now
  being updated, targets total sales of about six billion dlrs,
  including 2.50 billion dlrs in the U.S.
      Labatt, Canada's leading brewer, has expanded in the U.S.
  food products industry by acquisitions.
      Widdrington said Labatt's strategy for U.S. expansion
  stemmed partly from its strong market position in the Canadian
  food and beverage industry. The U.S. share of revenues for this
  year will be about 35 pct, rising to 40 pct in fiscal 1988, he
  said.

      The acquisition requires two-thirds approval by Husky

      If approved by shareholders, the amalgamation will take
  effect April 30, Husky said.
      Following completion, Oil Term Holdings Ltd, a new company

      Husky said a special committee of five outside directors
  recommended the board approve the transaction after determining
  that the deal was in the best interests of Husky and fair to
  shareholders.
      Husky previously announced shareholders will have the
  option to receive 11.80 Canadian dlrs cash for each common, or

4368,1,"FERC DECISION COULD CUT COLUMBIA GAS &lt;CG> NET
  Columbia Gas System Inc said a
  Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decision today on natural
  gas cost recovery could reduce its 1987 earnings by about 1.25
  dlrs a share.
      The company said ""this could bring earnings for 1987 below
  Columbia's stated goal of earning no less than its 3.18 dlrs
  per share dividend."" It earned 2.12 dlrs a share in 1986.
      It said management expects to recommend to the board that
  the dividend rate be maintained in 1987.
      Columbia Gas said the impact of the FERC decision may be
  offset by a one-time accounting change rleated to future tax
  liabilities under the new federal tax laws.
      The company recorded these liabilities based on older,
  higher tax rates, but an action being considered by the
  Financial Accounting Standards Board could result in a gain of
  about 1.20 dlrs a share in 1987, it explained.
      ""Thus there is a good chance that we will attain our 1987
  earnings goal -- although not in the way originally planned,""
  Columbia Gas said.
      Columbia Gas said the FERC decision would limit the
  recovery of certain gas contract costs by Columbia Gas
  Transmission Corp, the company's principal pipeline subsidiary.
      It said the decision specifically excluded from a purchased
  gas adjustment filing by the pipeline costs related to
  amortizing payments made to producers to reform gas purchase
  contracts. These were excluded on the grounds the subsidiary
  failed to sufficiently support cost recovery.
      The company said its subsidiary is not precluded from
  making a new filing to provide sufficient support.

4386,2,"U.S. SECURITIES GROUP BACKS INSIDER RESTRAINTS
  The Securities Industry Association
  backed a variety of restraints on insider trading and hostile
  corporate takeovers and asked Congress to define insider
  trading in law.
      The industry trade association called on U.S. securities
  firms to take steps to protect sensitive corporate secrets to
  guard against illegal trading by employees.
      The association also backed broad federal restrictions on a
  variety of tactics used in hostile corporate takeovers.
      But it said investment banking firms should be allowed to
  continue to engage in both arbitrage and merger and acquisition
  activities so long as those functions were kept separate.
      The SIA, in a report adopted yesterday by its board of
  directors, backed a higher enforcement budget for the federal
  Securities and Exchange Commission and called on U.S. stock
  exchanges to beef up their supervision of member brokerages.
      The report said securities firms ""should be more rigorous in
  restricting sensitive information on a need-to-know basis.""
      It said firms should train their employees to understand
  the need for confidentiality of market-sensitive information.
      It said legislation to define insider trading should avoid
  expanding current law in a way that would impede the market.
      It said an insider trading definition should exempt a
  securities firm from liability for law violations by its
  employees unless the firm had participated in or was aware of
  the wrongdoing.
      In the mergers and acquisitions area, the association
  advocated a ban on greenmail payments or poison pill takeover
  protection plans without prior shareholder approval.
      It said a group or individual buying up a company's stock
  should be required to file a public disclosure statement before
  acquiring more than five pct of the company's shares. Under
  current law, disclosure may be made as late as ten days after
  exceeding the five pct limit.
      The association said all purchases exceeding 20 pct of a
  company's voting stock shouls be made only through a tender
  offer open to all shareholders. Under current law there is no
  limit on open market purchases.
      The group said the federal government should preempt state
  regulation of defensive takeover tactics.
      The group said all tender offers should remain open for at
  least 30 calendar days.
      The current requirement is expressed in business days.
      It said so-called ""lockup"" devices, in which securities are
  issued to a friendly investor to seal a takeover deal or fend
  off an unfriendly predator should be limited to 18.5 pct of the
  target company's total common stock.
      Association president Edward O'Brien said the group acted
  out of concern over the ad hoc restructuring of corporate
  America on Wall Street and investor fears about insider trading
  and fairness in the marketplace.

  Southwestern Bell Corp said that
  its planned acquisitions of cellular telephone and paging
  systems, including those of &lt;Metromedia Inc>, will result in
  some initial earnings dilution and an increase in debt ratio.
      In a letter to shareholders in its 1986 annual report, the
  regional Bell company did not indicate the degree of earnings
  dilution it expects from the acquisitions, which total some
  1.38 billion dlrs. However, the company said the rise in its
  debt ratio will be temporary and will leave its debt level
  within an acceptable range.
      In its 1986 yearend financial statement, Southwestern Bell
  listed a debt-to-equity ratio of 43.4 pct, down slightly from
  43.7 pct in 1985.
      In 1986, the company earned 1.02 billion dlrs, or 10.26
  dlrs a share, compared with 996.2 mln dlrs, or 10 dlrs a share
  in 1985. Revenues dipped to 7.90 billion dlrs from 7.93 billion
  dlrs.
      Southwestern Bell said it expects the new tax law to have a
  negative impact on its cash flow, due mainly to the loss of
  investment tax credits.
      By mid-year, however, the company said a reduced corporate
  tax rate should have a positive impact on its net income and
  cash flow.
      In addition, the company said it is projecting a 1.7 pct
  gain in customer telephone lines and a three to four pct
  increase in long distance calling volumes.
      Southwestern Bell said 1987 capital expenditures will be
  lower that the 1.97 billion dlrs spent in 1986, a year in which
  expenditures were held below budget.

  Hotels Ltd &lt;SHLH.HK>'s stock soared on speculation of a
  takeover battle between major shareholders the Kadoorie family
  and the Evergo Industrial Enterprise Ltd &lt;EVGH.HK> group, stock
  brokers said.
      They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an
  announcement by Evergo's &lt;China Entertainment and Land
  Investment Co Ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk
  Hotels from the firm's deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06
  billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today.
      Thomas Lau, Evergo's executive director, declined comment
  on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels.
  But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought
  from Liang as long term investment.
      He said Evergo ""was attracted by the underlying strength of
  Hk Hotels.""
      Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible
  redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia's best known
  hotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by
  Hk Hotels.
      &lt;Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10
  pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs.
      Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun
  on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake.
      ""It is purely coincidence,"" he said.
      But analysts were not so certain, saying that the Evergo
  group, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, may team
  up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover.
      Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family, which
  analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. Michael
  Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels.
      Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to
  the Hk Hotels board.
      A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has
  not considered any countermoves so far.
      Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the
  Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management
  styles.
      ""Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and
  property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not
  fit the conservative Kadoorie family,"" said an analyst who asked
  not to be named.
      Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been
  distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is
  only worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and Lai
  Sun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below the
  current trading price.
      Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun, Evergo,
  China Entertainment and the group's associate &lt;Chinese Estates
  Ltd>.
      Chinese Estates lost 25 cents to 20.15 dlrs yesterday,
  China Entertainment five to 8.60 dlrs and Evergo one to 74
  cents. Lai Sun gained 50 cents to 70.50 dlrs.

4409,2,"KANSAS CITY &lt;KSU> READY TO BUY SOUTHERN PACIFIC
  Kansas City Southern Industries Inc
  said it is ready to promptly purchase the Southern Pacific
  Transportation Co from Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp &lt;SFX> if
  the Interstate Commerce Commission rejects Sante Fe's attempt
  to reopen the merger of Southern and the Atchison, Tokepa and
  Santa Fe Railway.
      In a filing with the ICC late today, the company outlined
  four conditions of its offer to acquire Southern Pacific.
      Among the conditions are that Santa Fe enter into an
  agreement to indemnify Kansas City for any contigent liabilites
  of Southern Pacific existing as of the closing date, and that
  the financial condition of Southern remain largely unchanged
  from today onward.
      ""We are willing, even eager, to make a fair market value
  offer in cash for the Southern Pacific,"" said Kansas City
  Southern president and chief executive officer Landon H.
  Rowland.
      ""This offer disproves the constant derogation of the
  Sourthern Pacific by SFSP management, best exemplified by SFSP
  Chief Executive John Schmidt's comment in ICC hearings that the
  Southern Pacific was 'bankrupt,'"" said Rowland.
      He said that merging Southern with Kansas City will achieve
  the benefits of an end-to-end merger while preseving the
  independece of the Southern Pacific versus its existing prime
  competitor, Santa Fe.
      Kansas said that Southern's management had estimated the
  value of the railroad in 1983 in the range of 281 mln dlrs to
  1.2 billion dlrs.
      It said that Morgan Stanley and Co Inc and Salomon Brothers
  Inc, hired in 1983 to advise Southern and Santa Fe in their
  merger, appraised Southern as worth between 500 mln dlrs and
  800 mln dlrs less than Southern's own internal valuations.
      Kanasa City Southern said it will make an offer for
  Southern after its books, records and properties are examined.
      ""Once that examination has been completed (and even in the
  absence of a willingnes of SFSP to negotiate) KCSI will make an
  offer in writing...."" said the company.
      Kansas also said it argued in the ICC filing that Santa Fe
  had not met the legal requirements justifying the Commission's
  reconsideration of the proposed merger of Santa Fe and Southern
  Pacific, two railroads that it said basically parallel each
  other throughout their routes.
      ICC voted four to one last summer to reject the merger as
  inherently anticompetitive. Kansas said Santa Fe in petitioning
  for reconsideration now argues that the trackage agreements
  with the Union Pacific, the Denver and Rio Grande Western and
  other railroads, adds to the value of the merger.

4410,2,"GENCORP &lt;GY> BID COULD BE RAISED, GROUP SAYS
  An investor group said it might be
  willing to raise its 100 dlr per share offer for GenCorp but so
  far the company has turned down requests for a meeting.
      ""We might be able to see some additional value if we could
  meet"" and get more financial data, said Joel Reed, speaking for
  the investor group.
      Reed told Reuters that GenCorp chairman A. William Reynolds
  ""was not interested in sitting down and talking with us at this
  time."" Cyril Wagner sought the meeting in a recent telephone
  conversation with Reynolds, Reed said.
      Wagner and Brown, along with AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG>,
  recently launched a surprise tender offer for GenCorp. The
  offer is worth 2.23 billion dlrs.
      Reed said under the circumstances the 100 dlr per share
  tender offer, which expires April 15, is a fair offer. GenCorp
  gained 3-1/2 to 114 today on the NYSE.
      Reed outlined a plan to reshape GenCorp in the event his
  group wins control. He said aerospace, soft drink bottling and
  entertainment units are potential divestiture candidates. He
  said the tire business, which the group wants to keep, may be
  more viable if merged with another tire company.
      ""One option would be to try to grow the tire business
  through combination or an acquisition,"" Reed said. He said he
  believes such a merger could create a stronger force in the
  tire industry.
      Gary Miller, chief financial officer of AFG, said his
  company has a record of acquiring mature businesses and
  boosting productivity. Automation and incentives tied to profit
  sharing have been used with success, he said.
      In the case of GenCorp's RKO General broadcasting stations,
  Reed said the plan of the partners is to step into GenCorp's
  shoes and proceed with plans to  sell the stations.
      The partners said if they succed in acquiring GenCorp they
  intend to consummate sale of WOR-TV in New York to MCA Inc
  &lt;MCA>. GenCorp last year entered into an agreement to sell the
  station for 387 mln dlrs.
      The partners also said if they acquire Gencorp they would
  also proceed with the proposed sale of KHJ-TV in Los Angeles to
  Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS>. RKO General would receive 217 mln dlrs
  and Fidelilty Television, which challenged the license, would
  get about 103 mln dlrs.
      The partners also said the Federal Communications
  Commission established an expedited schedule for receiving
  comments on their request for special temporary authorization
  of proposed trust arrangements while the FCC considers a formal
  application for transfer of the broadcast unit.
      Reed said he was pleased with the expedited schedule
  because it provides time for the agency to act on the request
  before the expiration of the tender offer.
      He said it was the aim of the partners to move as quickly
  as possible to eliminate uncertainty surrounding the stations.
      Asked about criticism of the takeover attempt voiced by
  some municipal officials in Akron, Ohio, where GenCorp is
  headquartered, Reed said, ""the plan of the partners offers long
  term growth for Ohio.""
      He noted that the aerospace business, slated for
  divestiture under the partners' plan, is located in California.
  ""Our program is one that overall would provide the greatest
  long term growth for all segments,"" he said.

  Varity Corp, earlier reporting a full

  expected in the balance of fiscal 1987 as new products fill the
  inventory pipeline, cutbacks in operating costs are realized
  and its newly acquired Dayton Walther business is fully
  integrated.
      However, operating results are likely to remain under
  pressure in the first quarter ending April 30, it said.
      Varity earlier reported a loss for fiscal 1986 ended
  January 31 of 23.3 mln U.S. dlrs, compared to a year-earlier
  profit of 3.9 mln dlrs.
      Varity said continued deterioration in major markets, a
  weakening U.S. dollar and unforeseen delays in launching major
  new lines of tractors contributed to the full year loss.
      Industry demand for farm machinery continued to erode
  during the latest fiscal year, with worldwide industry retail
  sales of tractors sliding more than 10 pct below last year's
  depressed levels, the company said.
      However, Varity increased its share of the global tractor
  market by more than one pct to 18.2 pct, it said.
      The combined impact of costly sales incentives and foreign
  exchange adjustments on margins was substantial, Varity said.

  the first two months of 1987, 5.2 pct more than in the same
  1986 period, management board chairman Hans Meinhardt said.
      But world group incoming orders fell 2.2 pct to 587.3 mln
  marks, Meinhardt told the annual news conference. Excluding
  exchange rate movements, world group turnover rose 8.9 pct and
  incoming orders increased 1.0 pct.
      Linde expects satisfactory results and increased sales this
  year but Meinhardt gave no detailed forecast. Domestic group
  1986 net profit rose to 105.79 mln marks from 80.71 mln.
      Meinhardt said domestic group turnover rose 6.7 pct to
  394.1 mln marks in the first two 1987 months against the same
  period last year but incoming orders fell 5.2 pct to 456.6 mln.
      Linde will ask shareholders at the annual meeting on May 13
  to raise authorised share capital by a maximum 30 mln marks
  nominal for the issue of share warrant bonds with a maximum
  issue volume of 200 mln marks. Linde's authorised share capital
  currently stands at a nominal 49.6 mln marks.
      Meinhardt said the authorisation would give the company the
  necessary flexibility in case Linde needed additional funds for
  acquisitions. He declined to give further details.
      While world group turnover rose 7.2 pct to 3.88 billion
  marks in 1986, incoming orders were barely changed at 3.91
  billion marks. Meinhardt said without the sharp appreciation of
  the mark against major trading partner currencies, incoming
  orders would have been four pct above the prior year's level.
      World group turnover in heavy plant construction rose 7.4
  pct to 777 mln marks, but incoming orders dropped 5.7 pct to
  739 mln marks in the wake of the dollar and oil price plunge.
      World sales for technical gases rose 5.1 pct to 1.05
  billion marks and incoming orders gained 5.2 pct to 1.05
  billion marks.
      Meinhardt said Linde strengthened its market position in
  the refrigeration sector, with particularly strong turnover and
  order gains in Austria, Italy and Norway. World group sales in
  the sector fell 2.5 pct to 493 mln marks, but incoming orders
  rose 2.5 pct to 513 mln marks.
      The fork lift truck and hydraulic sector saw world group

  a total of 7.4 billion if the offer is fully accepted.
      The offer would be made through its &lt;BP North America Inc>
  unit and was intended to commence not later than April 1. The
  offer would not be conditional on any minimum number of shares
  being tendered.
      BP said in a statement the 70 dlr a share price was based
  on its own valuation as well as those of its financial
  advisers. It took into account reviews of both public and
  non-public information.
      Standard closed in New York last night at 64-7/8 dlrs, down
  1-3/4 dlrs.
      BP shares dropped on the announcement to 877p from 888p at
  last night's close.
      About a third of the cash payable would be met from BP's
  own resources.
      The remainder would come from new borrowings, partly from
  banks under a four-year committed revolving credit facility and
  partly from a a new U.S. Dlr commercial paper programme. The
  company said it was in the course of arranging these
  facilities.

  use of its financial resources. It was confident oil prices
  were likely to remain within a range sufficient to justify the
  investment.
      Walters added that it also felt that, due to management
  changes in 1986, Standard could now operate successfully even
  in a lower oil price environment.
      Standard's net assets at end-1986 were 7.02 billion dlrs
  and in the year it reported a loss of 1.08 billion dlrs before
  tax and before an extraordinary item of 608 mln dlrs.
      Analysts said that the move by BP had come as a surprise.
  One noted that it was not immediately clear why the group
  should spend so much money buying a company it already
  controlled.
      BP could also have bought up the remainder of Standard
  shares considerably cheaper had it moved six months ago.
      It was also unclear what effect the tender would have on
  the U.K. Government's recent announcement that it intended to
  dispose of its remaining 31.7 pct stake in BP sometime in the
  1987/88 financial year, analysts said.
      Analyst Paul Spedding of brokers Kleinwort Grieveson noted
  that any effect on the government sale of its stake in BP would
  depend on the reaction of the markets.
      The deal would probably push BP's gearing up to around 59
  pct from 20 pct currently, he said.
      However, with the likelihood that oil prices would not
  repeat last year's rapid drop the prospects for Standard
  returning to profitability this year -- and BP benefitting from
  its cash flow -- were good.
      Standard was a high cost oil producer, the analysts noted.
      Spedding noted that it needed about 12 dlrs a barrel to
  make money, and at about 15 dlrs a barrel revenue from
  production and its downstream activities would push it
  comfortably into surplus.
      BP initially took a stake in Standard following the
  discovery of oil in Alaska's Prudhoe bay in 1969. BP had
  inadequate distribution facilities in the U.S. While Standard,
  which was strong on marketing and refining, was short on crude
  oil.
      The analysts said that BP had promoted a major management
  reorganisation of Standard in the past year.
      The probability that much of the shake-up at Standard was
  now complete was one possible factor behind the timing of the
  tender offer, Spedding said.
      BP's willingness to take hard decisions such as major
  balance sheet write offs and the sale of assets had been well
  received in the markets.
      The lower costs that should now be possible -- especially
  after the rationalisation of the loss making minerals division
  -- should allow the benefits of an oil price recovery to come
  straight through to 1987 profits without being cut back by
  other sectors.

4431,1,"HOECHST RAISES PROFITS ON LOWER SALES
  Hoechst AG &lt;HFAG.F> said in a
  statement it increased its pretax profits in 1986 despite a
  fall in turnover due to lower foreign sales.
      The lower sales were due to the fall in the dollar and
  other currencies against the mark. Other factors were pressure
  on selling prices because of a sharp fall in the prices of
  crude oil and petrochemical raw materials and the sale of
  polystyrene business in the U.S. And Netherlands.
      World group pretax profit rose to 3.21 billion marks in
  1986 from 3.16 billion in 1985, with sales falling to 38.01
  billion from 42.72 billion.
      Within group turnover, foreign sales fell to 27.18 billion
  marks in 1986 from 31.92 billion in 1985, a drop of 14.9 pct.
      The statement made no mention of net profit figures.
  Hoechst will announce its dividend proposal on April 23.
      In the first quarter of this year sales were hit by the
  cold weather at the start of the year. If the dollar continues
  at present low levels, 1987 sales will again be below the
  previous year, although in volume terms they are unchanged from
  1986, Hoechst said.
      Sales of paints and dyes, fibres, sheeting and information
  technology all rose in 1986 but plant construction sales fell.
      Hoechst attributed its good results to the performance of
  the parent company, other units in West Germany, and to
  &lt;American Hoechst Corp>.
      Improved earnings in the U.S. Largely reflected the
  restructuring of styrene and polystyrene activities.
      Roussel Uclaf &lt;RUCF.PA> and most domestic non-consolidated
  partners did not perform as well as in 1985.
      Hoechst attributed the 12 pct rise in parent company pretax
  profits to 1.82 billion marks above all to a rise in earnings
  from interest and holdings in other companies, and a fall in
  extraordinary costs.
      The fall in raw material prices was not enough to
  compensate for the decline in turnover due to lower prices and
  currencies, Hoechst said.
      The bulk of the 2.53 billion marks investment in new
  projects, up from 294 mln marks in 1985, went on the capital
  increase of Hoechst Capital Corp in connection with the
  acquisition of &lt;Celanese Corp>.
      Celanese was merged with American Hoechst in February to
  form &lt;Hoechst Celanese Corp>.

4432,1,"BHP NET SEEN AROUND 600 MLN DLRS FOR NINE MONTHS
  Australia's largest company, The Broken
  Hill Pty Co Ltd &lt;BRKN.S> (BHP), is expected to report a net
  profit of around 600 mln to 620 mln dlrs tomorrow for the first
  nine months ended February 28, share analysts polled by Reuters
  said.
      This would be well below the 813.0 mln dlrs earned in the
  first three quarters of 1985/86. In the full year ended May 31
  1986 the group earned a record 988.2 mln dlrs.
      The analysts estimated that the group would report a third
  quarter net in the region of 200 mln to 220 mln dlrs, against
  238.6 mln a year earlier and 220.3 mln in the second quarter.
      BHP's earnings in the first half ended November 30 amounted
  to 397.0 mln dlrs, sharply down from 589.3 mln a year earlier.
      The analysts predicted that BHP will report an upturn in
  petroleum earnings compared with the first quarter, reflecting
  some improvement in crude oil prices from the Bass Strait
  fields, but these gains would be offset by lower mineral and
  steel earnings.
      They said the mineral group has been hit by lower coal
  prices and shipments to Japan while the steel division has been
  affected by industrial and production problems.
      The analysts noted that the third quarter is normally BHP's
  lowest-earning period owing to a number of seasonal factors,
  and they predicted a sharp rise in fourth quarter net to around
  300 mln dlrs.
      One key factor in the fourth quarter is expected to be a
  tax break of some 70 mln dlrs for the investment allowance on
  capital expenditure in the steel division, they said.
      They said they saw BHP's full year earnings at around 900
  mln to 920 mln dlrs. They added that such a decline from
  1985/86 would be no surprise, noting BHP has said that it would
  be difficult to equal its record 1985/86 net profit.

  BP International and BP North America
  are seeking a five billion dlr, four year syndicated credit
  facility in support of British Petroleum Co Plc's tender offer
  for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co it does not already own,
  Morgan Guaranty Trust Co of New York said as arranger.
      The facility, to be guaranteed by British Petroleum Co Plc
  &lt;BP.L> is probably the largest credit facility ever arranged in
  Europe, bond analysts said. Full terms will be announced either
  later today or tomorrow morning. BP said earlier it planned a
  tender offer for the 45 pct of Standard it does not already own
  for 70 dlrs a share cash.
      The financing being arranged by Morgan Guaranty will take
  the form of a fully committed revolving credit. As announced
  earlier, BP also is arranging a U.S. Commercial paper program
  in connection with the tender and part of the revolver will be
  used to support that program.
      The exact size of the U.S. Program has not been decided and
  the dealers have not yet been chosen.
      The credit facility will also allow the borrower to issue
  cash advances with maturities of one, three or six months
  through a tender panel, which will be comprised of banks
  committed to the facility.
      Despite the unprecedented size of this euromarket facility,
  Morgan Guaranty said that it was being syndicated only among
  BP's relationship banks.
      As a result, banks were being offered lead manager status
  at 200 mln dlrs, co-lead management at 125 mln and manager at
  75 mln.
      Although pricing on many credit facilities has become
  extremely fine in recent years because of the keen competition
  to win mandates, Morgan Guaranty said banks would be
  compensated fairly since this is a special purpose facility
  which must be completed quickly, with signing expected in about
  10 days.

      The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications has urged the

4439,1,"SIEMENS SEES SALES NEAR 52 BILLION MARKS THIS YEAR
  World group turnover of Siemens AG
  &lt;SIEG.F> should rise to 51 or 52 billion marks in the current
  year to September 31 after a 19 pct upturn in the first five
  months, management board chairman Karlheinz Kaske said.
      Siemens reported world group turnover in 1985/86 of 47.02
  billion marks.
      Kaske told the annual shareholders meeting turnover rose to
  21.2 billion marks in the first five months of 1986/87, about
  19 pct above the same year-ago period. The rise was mainly due
  to payment in January for a West German nuclear power station
  which led to a jump in domestic sales of 36 pct.
      In the first five 1986/87 months, turnover abroad showed a
  three pct increase, Kaske said, without giving figures.
      In the same period incoming orders rose five pct to 21.8
  billion marks against the same 1985/86 period.
      For the year as a whole incoming orders should rise between
  one and two billion marks to around 51 or 52 billion.
      Apart from payments for the nuclear power station, the
  communications and telecommunications sectors in particular
  should contribute to growth this year, Kaske said.
      But it was not possible to make a profit forecast for
  1986/87 because of uncertainty about the direction of the
  dollar, Kaske said.
      Siemens already reported that first quarter 1986/87 group
  net profit fell marginally to 296 mln marks from 298 mln in the
  same period in the previous year.
      Turnover in the first five months rose particularly
  strongly in the installations and automotive technology,
  communications and telecommunications sectors, but components
  and energy and automation showed a sharp decline.
      Kaske said domestic orders rose to 10.2 billion marks in
  the first five months of this year, or nine pct above their
  level in the same 1985/86 period, boosted in particular by
  orders for the fully owned Kraftwerk Union AG subsidiary.
      Foreign orders grew one pct to 11.6 billion marks. An
  increase in orders through newly acquired subsidiaries abroad
  was balanced by the decline in the dollar.
      While the installations and automotive technology sector
  showed a sharp rise in orders, energy and automation and
  communications orders were below the level achieved in the same
  period of 1985/86.
      Telecommunications orders remained at roughly the same
  level.
      Kaske said investments were expected to remain around six
  billion marks in 1986/87 after a 50 pct increase the previous
  year. Research and development were likely to rise 13 pct to
  6.1 billion marks or around 12 pct of turnover.
  

"
4440,1,"KRUPP HAS SATISFACTORY 1986 RESULTS
  The Fried. Krupp GmbH
  &lt;KRPG.D> steel and engineering group said it had a satisfactory
  1986 despite a provisional 12 pct fall in total group sales to
  18.1 billion marks from 20.7 billion the previous year.
      Third party turnover declined to 15.9 billion from 18.5
  billion in 1985 while orders slipped to 15.5 billion marks from
  16.9 billion, it said in a preliminary statement.
      Despite these figures, which reflected the dollar's
  weakness against the mark and oil and raw materials price
  falls, it said 1986 was a satisfactory year.
      The reason was the continued expansion of the machinery and
  plant sector, which accounted for 42 pct of total sales.
      Krupp added that some areas of the mechanical engineering
  business achieved notable growth rates and acquisitions had
  underpinned machinery and component activities.
      An orders decline in the steel and, in particular, the
  trading and services sectors, affected the group's total order
  figures.
      However, ""all business sectors contributed to the positive
  results achieved in 1986,"" Krupp added, without giving details.
      Domestic orders decreased by five pct to 9.6 billion marks
  from the previous year and foreign orders fell 14 pct to 5.9
  billion, it said. Foreign business accounted for 38 pct of
  orders against 40 pct in 1985.
      Orders received by the machinery and plant sector, 11
  member companies which comprise the core area of the group,
  rose by four mln marks last year to 6.9 billion, Krupp said.
      The group's orders in hand amounted to 9.1 billion marks at
  end-December 1986 from 10.3 billion at the start of the year.
      Orders received by the steel sector last year decreased by
  three pct to 6.2 billion marks from 1985, it said.
      The steel market weakened increasingly over the year,
  mainly because of exchange rate movements, the deterioration in
  foreign trade and a downturn in a number of customer
  industries.
      The difficult market for sections and flats of quality
  steel depressed order tonnages by around seven pct, Krupp said.
  But special steel boosted by strong demand for stainless
  cold-rolled flats, grew by five pct in tonnage terms.

  Equatorial Communications
  Co said it expects to report losses of about 57 mln dlrs for
  the fourth quarter and 68 mln dlrs for the full year 1986 on
  revenues of about 10 mln dlrs for the quarter and 52 mln dlrs
  for the year.
      Equatorial said the losses will include a charge of about
  45 mln dlrs from costs associated with the restructuring of its
  business, including adjustments to reflect the market value of
  transponders owned and leased by Equatorial and other reserves
  for inventory, receivables and excess facilities.
      Equatorial said the fourth quarter operating results will
  also include restructuring costs of about 5,500,000 dlrs, in
  addition to the 45 mln dlr charge.
      Equitorial also said that as of March One it is operating
  in technical default under its lease of transponders on the
  Galaxy III satellite due to its inabiliuty to maintain
  agreed-upon financial ratios.  It said it is in talks with the
  lessors in an attempt to restructure lease obligations.
      Further, Equitorial said it is in default of two other
  oblitations in connection with the purchase or lease of
  transponders as a result of cross-default provisions.
      Equatorial said it has signed a memorandum of understanding
  for Contel Corp &lt;CTC> to purchase 10 mln dlrs of Equatorial
  master earth stations, micro earth stations and associated
  equipment and loan Equatorial six mln dlrs over a six-month
  period for repayment starting in December 1988.
      The company said Conteol, under the agreement, would assume
  a portion of Equatorial's rights and obligations under the
  Galaxy III transponder lease with &lt;Burnham Leasing> on the
  occurrence of certain events.
      Equatorial said it would grant Contel an option to buy
  about 3,600,000 common shares at 3.25 dlrs each.
      Equatorial said its understandings with Contel are subject
  to Equatorial's ability to restructure a significant portion of
  its obligations and to obtain concessions from lenders and
  lessors, in particular under its Galaxy III transponder lease.
  It said it hopes to finalize a Contel agreement by April 15.
      Equatorial in 1985 earned 1,807,000 dlrs after a 3,197,000
  dlr gain from early debt retirement on revenues of 56.1 mln
  dlrs. For the first nine months of 1986, the company lost
  9,476,000 dlrs on revenues of 45.4 mln dlrs, compared with a
  1,784,000 dlr profit after the early retirement gain on
  revenues of 38.5 mln dlrs.

      He declined to predict specific results for the first

      Previously, the company had said first quarter results

  line changes scheduled during the first quarter, its statement
  pointed out.
      While the disruptive effects of the production line changes

  first quarter operating results were helped by lower than
  anticipated operating costs and improved margins on sales as a
  result of a more favorable product mix.

  Bank of Boston Corp expects first
  quarter earnings will range between 90 cts and one dlr a share,
  up from 79 cts a share last year, Chairman William Brown said.
      He told shareholders the company has a 190 mln dlr exposure
  in loans to Brazil if that country defaults on its debt
  payments. If a default does occur, it would first quarter
  earnings by about five cts a share, which would bring the
  bank's in the lower level of the estimated range, he added.
      Brown noted the 1986 first quarter net included a 17 cts
  gain from loan restructurings which will not appear this year.
      Brown said the bank's other nonperforming assets, not
  including its Brazilian exposure, could rise to over 700 mln
  dlrs at the end of this quarter compared with 669 mln dlrs a
  year earlier and 614 mln dlrs at the end of 1986.
      He said the increase includes all of its Equadorian loans
  which he expects will be ultimately repaid after the company
  recovers from an earthquake earlier this year.
      Brown said the increase also includes some Mexican and
  Venezuelan loans as those nations are also facing credit
  problems.
      Brown said the Bank of Boston remains ""cautiously optimitic
  about the full year even if our Brazilian exposure were to be
  on nonaccural all year."" In 1986, the bank earned 3.69 dlrs a
  share, or 232.8 mln dlrs on net interest revenues of 1.08
  billion dlrs.
      President Ira Stepanian told the shareholders's meeting the
  bank's total loans to Argentina, Brazil and Mexico totaled 875
  mln dlrs at the end of 1986, 37 pct of its primary capital.
  Brazil loans total 300 mln dlrs, of which about two-thirds are

  remain at 1986 levels.
      The improvement will result from production increases,

  Criticism it is blocking American Telephone and Telegraph
  Corp's &lt;T.N>, AT and T, entry into French telecommunications
  firm &lt;Compagnie Generale Constructions Telephoniques>, CGCT.
      Management board member Hans Baur told journalists that the
  acquisition of a joint 20 pct stake in CGCT by AT and T and
  Philips Gloeilampenfabrieken NV &lt;PGLO.AS> had not been decided
  on two years ago as claimed by AT and T.
      The French government, which owns CGCT, had asked Siemens
  at the start of 1986 to submit an offer for the stake in CGCT.
  The result of the negotiations was still open.
      Baur said Siemens had first made an offer last summer.
      The Handelsblatt newspaper today quoted AT and T chairman
  James E. Olson as saying that Siemens' attempt to stop AT and T
  and Philips could lead to a resurgence of protectionism in the
  U.S.
      Baur said he expected the French government to decide on
  the winning bid by the end of April. CGCT's share of the French
  switchboard market amounts to around 16 pct.
      The French government has limited CGCT participation by
  foreign companies to 20 pct and set a price of 500 mln francs
  for the whole company.
      Bauer said the 20 pct limitation would only apply to the
  initial stake. He did not rule out a stake increase later but
  said Siemens' aim was to introduce its technology.
      Bauer said Siemens and French telecommunications firm
  &lt;Jeumont-Schneider SA> submitted a joint offer at the start of
  March because of the 20 pct limitation. Both companies will
  form a joint venture to take over the whole of CGCT.
     Siemens will have a 20 pct stake in the new company while
  Jeumont-Schneider will own 80 pct. Apart from investing 100 mln
  francs for the modernisation of CGCT, a new research centre

4518,2,"FIRST INTERSTATE SEEKS ACQUISITION
  Less than two months after First
  Interstate Bancorp withdrew its bold attempt to buy BankAmerica
  Corp, Chairman Joseph Pinola is still looking for a good buy,
  but he is also looking at ways to avoid being bought.
      In a wide-ranging interview, Pinola said he's looking for
  ways to improve profitability and capital between now and 1991,
  ""so as to resist any potential look at us...to maintain our
  independence, if possible.""
      In 1991 federal regulatory changes will allow the major
  East Coast banks to buy banks in California.
      First Interstate, the fourth largest California bank, and
  the nineth largest nationwide, owns 24 banks in 12 western
  states and has franchise operations in four additional states.
      Bank industry sources say it is an attractive target for
  large U.S. or foreign banks, looking to quickly move into the 
  lucrative California market and the West Coast region.
      While declining specifics on his corporate strategy, when
  asked if acquisitions will be part of the plan, Pinola replied,
  ""That's undoubtedly a fair statement...it would be almost naive
  not to think that.""
      Pinola characterized his acquisition strategy as
  ""opportunistic"".
      He said he will look for banks in management trouble that
  he can get at a bargain, then add management to restore
  profitability, or for banks in states where First Interstate
  already operates, then cut costs by combining resources.
      The exception, he said, would be Texas, where he said most
  of the banks are already well managed, but might be purchased
  at a discount because of the depressed regional economy.
      Pinola declined comment on what circumstances might move
  him to rekindle his bid for BankAmerica, saying only, ""We
  continue to monitor and look at a lot of things and a lot of
  people continue to monitor and look at us.""
      Banking analysts, however, consider another First
  Interstate bid at BankAmerica a long shot, not likely to happen
  any time soon.
      Pinola called his decision last month to withdraw his 3.25
  billion dlr bid at the nation's second largest bank, ""a very,
  very difficult decision.""
      With that decision made, however, he acknowledged First
  Interstate may now have a difficult time keeping its number
  four position in the California banking community.
      ""The competition in this state is tough,"" he said, noting
  CityBank's recent purchase of 50 financial service branches
  from Sears Roebuck company. ""CityBank is moving rapidly to move
  us down to fifth and Wells Fargo down to fourth,"" he said.
      Outside California, Pinola acknowledged that Security
  Pacific Corp, with its recent acquisitions in Arizona,
  Washington and Oregon, is quickly becoming a regional
  competitor in areas where First Interstate has long dominated.
      ""Security is, has been and continues to be a highly
  profitable and obviously well managed company,"" he said.
      He added, however, First Interstate, at the moment, has the
  advantages of having owned and managed regional banks longer
  and has the recognition advantage of having given its regional
  banks a common name.
      Pinola said while its coastal state banks are in good
  financial condition, First Interstate continues to sustain
  serious loan losses in its Rocky Mountain states, where energy,
  real estate and agriculture dominate the economy.
      Asked if he thought loan losses in those areas had peaked,
  he said, ""I don't think it has bottomed out, because I think
  most of the problems are real estate-related and the real
  estate problems are going to be with us for several years.""
      Pinola said another failing economic sector, agriculture in
  the Midwest, has slowed expansion of First Interstate's
  franchise operation.
      First Interstate has 42 franchise banks that offer First
  Interstate financial services in ten states.
      While a year ago he was considering taking his franchise
  operation east of the Mississippi River, Pinola said because
  most of the franchise banks are now in the West, expansion into
  the Midwest must come first.
      Calling the franchise system, ""moderately profitable,""
  Pinola said, ""It is going to take a rejuvenation of the
  agriculture sector for us to commence franchising at the speed
  we were generating before the last year or two.""
      On the banking industry in general, Pinola said he thinks
  1987 will be another bad year for loan losses, with only banks
  with minimal holdings in real estate able to improve profits.
