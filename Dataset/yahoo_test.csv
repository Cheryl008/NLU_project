0,1,I would say that this is against both evolution and creationism.  \n\nIf humans were not from earth then why would we have so many similar internal organs to other animals?  I mean I doubt any extraterrestrial creature could have a pig's heart transplanted into their body like humans can.\n\nIt could be that humans were in some way altered by aliens or our culture is influenced by aliens.  But this lacks any real evidence at present and is thus a very unlikly (but not impossible) case.\n\nPersonally I think there are aliens of some sort but they are not amongst us in any conventional sense at the moment.

5,1,"A windmill is an engine powered by the wind to produce energy, often contained in a large building as in traditional post mills, smock mills and tower mills. The energy windmills produce can be used in many ways, traditionally for grinding grain, pumping water, sawing wood or hammering seeds. Modern wind power machines are used for generating electricity and are more properly called wind turbines."
6,1,"Yeah, it's a placeholder text. It's derived from a text written in Latin, but it doesn't really mean anything, those are just some random words. Anyways, if you're interested, check out the article on Wikipedia."
7,1,"There is no code. God does not keep secrets. The Bible is very Black and white. It is straight forward. Do not fall into trying to decode. That is the work of Satan.\nAs far as the war, you speak of ...YES! Watch Pastor Hagee he will explain the Bible Prophecy. He does not assume or use his own interpretation of what he imagines. He uses the Bible and explains what the Bible means. He interprets the written word in accordance to Biblical knowledge. He is very well educated. The Bible does teach us that man will destroy himself and the earth. Yes, this will occur when Iran, the Imam, uses nuclear weapons to attack Israel. The Imam believes his mission is to kill the Jews in Israel and then to kill Americans. Today, Iran has been acquiring the Nuclear weapons to complete it's believed to be mission.  China has been helping Iran for the past 2 years, to do so. The explained theory is that Imam and Iranians will first attack the Jews in Israel and then infiltrate bombs into America. God tells us to keep our eye on Israel, when the things come to pass there, as foretold, we are headed for the Holy War. The Jews are God's protected people. We are to treat them with love and respect and honor. The Bible is true. I urge people to read it. To pray and build a personal relationship with the Lord. Live to better the world. The most important thing is not that the world will end or how it ends. The most important thing is how we all live our life both now and eternally. Go forth and teach the saving message of Christ to all nations.\nAs the Bible predicts: There are wars, famine, disease, storms, earthquakes and so on throughout the world. There are social problems and people looking for peace and can not find it. There has come the time that brother against brother and so on. The US is at War in Iraq & Saudi. The US has enemies in many countires. This is a time of turbulenece. When China backs Iran and in turn Iran attcks Israel and the US this will result in a major world war."

9,1,"Oo, the Bermuda Triangle!\n\nIt is possible... we could be nothing but computer simulations. Wouldn't that put a dampener on those stupid 'religious' conflicts?! \n\nSightings of ghosts and aliens can be explained by psychological phenomena, though... but the idea that they could be programming quirks/errors is intriguing nonetheless. \n\nIf this computer simulation analogy proves to be true, then it would seem that the programmer is getting better as humans are now generally living longer, somewhat. \n\nIt would explain why we can't make much headway into Space yet! The programmer is still working on his/her/its program! lol\n\nOur society could be the sewer of another greater society above us!, to paraphrase Futurama's sewer mutants."
10,1,"It is not right to lump all people who say they are Christian into one group. There is no ""American Christian"" church and there are no ""Christian States"". (It is illegal in the United States for the government to prefer any religion or creed.) Christianity is not the only religion whose tenets have been perverted by violent people.  It's not Christianity or Islam or any other religion that is the problem, but rather people who hate other people. Any facet of human life where people have different opinions, appearances, or practices can be and has been used by unscrupulous people as a basis for carrying out their programs of hate. Lumping all the people of one belief or race or culture together and calling them names is just the first step in these programs. Do you really want to go down that path?"
11,1,because that's they way it was always going to be! but don't be down beat because there are still a lot of true Christians out there! i like to think I'm one of them. keep up the fellowship of Jesus because he will never abandon us. i see from 1 of your answers to my questions you are also 1 of them few. god bless

22,1,"It's not necessary to categorize your belief unless you want to. All major organized religions are tainted with superstition and mythologies (and tales of suffering and damnation).

23,1,"Easter falls on the first Sunday after the first full moon after the vernal equinox (or autumnal equinox if you live in the Southern Hemisphere).  That's why it's called ""a moveable feast.""  It's a combination of Catholic (Sunday) and pagen (equinox, full moon) symbols. \n\nFather's Day and Mother's Day are determined by whoever makes them up.  Mother's Day was created by a woman to honor her mother.  She lobbied various lawmakers until it became a quasi official holiday.\n\nIf you could get Congress to establish a Swedish One Armed Albinos Day, you could pick the date....but it might be hard going to persuade anyone to honor this particular group."

28,1,"Very good question, but I'll warn you, some of the radical Christians will flag it as a violation just for asking it.  If he could have written it, it would have only been the New Testament. It was written by the men of the time to serve their own purposes, just as people today only quote the passages which support their point of view. If the Christians truly lived as Jesus did (if he ever existed) they would not be so judgemental.  If they lived as Jesus did, life would be a lot better for everyone.    As for the second part of your question. Nothing in the Bible makes sense. It contradicts itself every step of the way. It's full of violence......murder, rape, beatings......I grew up in the church & read the whole thing once & parts of it several times. I've explored several other religions & am now agnostic."

All i can do is putt flowers on her grave and say I'm sorry."
32,1,literacy is very important because you can't learn about God unless you are able to read the bible. Sure someone can tell you but it's good to read what the bible says to make sure what that person is saying is true.
33,1,"I have, and I'm an American.  You know what?  Take a look at South Africa today, (Where the majority of slaves where kid napped from).  I'd have to say that the Africans have had it way better here, despite the few years they where in slaved.  I guess the Africans who are still bitter should be given a one way ticket home. To absolute poverty, famine, disease and destruction."
34,1,"I think it means ""being done with your work"", so Heaven. Since God's rest came when His work was done, so we will too. The Sabbath is just a way to observe God's day of rest until we go through it in Heaven. I think.... so God bless you and I hope this will help."

39,1,"It means through a chain of no more than 6 people you can connect yourself to any person in the world.  It may not be universally true, and it requires certain channels of communications (eg. a famous person you know is a better link than Joe Blow).\n\nFor example, I met my member of parliament in Canada.  He works with the Canadian Prime minister.  The PM knows the US president.  Shrub has (probably) met your senator.  And you could meet your senator.  That's a separation of only four people to get from me to you."
40,1,"What ""procedures"" are you referring to?  Common-law refers to couples (usually only male/female couples) who have lived as husband and wife for a particular period of time.  The laws pertaining to these relationships differ from state-to-state, and common-law relationships are not recognized in some states.  Your best bet would be to address this question to your local court of law, or possibly search the internet (although you should be wary of information found there)."

I am a Romanian, so now I have to answer to what I think about the people I meet daily. :) \n I think that Romanians are very smart, first. Then they are less civilizated ( well, this is bad but it goes hand-on-hand with the first point mentioned). \n You also asked if they are nice and friendly. I'm not really sure what to say about this.... Romanian teenagers sometimes suck :P They're full of teribilism, I say, but with strangers they are very nice, usually. :) What more can I say?!?!

46,1,"Yes, it's true.  Developing dark skin was nature's way of providing more protection from the sun's rays. That's why people tan, it's to help protect the skin. Light skin burns easily. Light eyes are more sensitive to bright light. Have you also noticed that  most black americans are not real dark like true africans? They aren't exposed to that harsh sun anymore and have lightened up. I'm not sure about the hair ""curling up from steam"" it sounds reasonable, but actually, straight hair when seen under a microscope is round like a pencil, and tight curly hair is flatter like a ruler. Soft curly hair is oval shaped. It's the follicles that determine curly or straight. But hey, it might have originated that way from heat, I don't know.\nps. I think brown skin and green eyes are gorgeous, and also shiny black hair with ice blue eyes too. It's different."

49,1,"Kamehameha, also known as Kamehameha I and Kamehameha the Great (circa 1758-1819), unified the Hawaiian Islands in battle and formally established the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi in 1810. A skilled diplomat, Kamehameha developed friendships with the major colonial powers in the Pacific resulting in the preservation of independence, as well as a guarantee of peace and prosperity of the kingdom, for future generations of native Hawaiians. Kamehameha is most noted for his vehement defense of traditional Hawaiian values and the kapu system of law and religion. He is also remembered for mamalahoe or the Law of the Splintered Paddle, used today throughout the world protecting the human rights of non-combatants in times of battle."

The discovery that waves could be measured in particle-like small packets of energy called quanta led to the branch of physics that deals with atomic and subatomic systems which we today call Quantum Mechanics. The foundations of quantum mechanics were established during the first half of the twentieth century by Werner Heisenberg, Max Planck, Louis de Broglie, Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, Max Born, John von Neumann, Paul Dirac, Albert Einstein, Wolfgang Pauli and others. Some fundamental aspects of the theory are still actively studied.\n\nQuantum mechanics is a more fundamental theory than Newtonian mechanics and classical electromagnetism, in the sense that it provides accurate and precise descriptions for many phenomena that these ""classical"" theories simply cannot explain on the atomic and subatomic level. It is necessary to use quantum mechanics to understand the behavior of systems at atomic length scales and smaller. For example, if Newtonian mechanics governed the workings of an atom, electrons would rapidly travel towards and collide with the nucleus. However, in the natural world the electron normally remains in a stable orbit around a nucleus — seemingly defying classical electromagnetism.\n\nQuantum mechanics was initially developed to explain the atom, especially the spectra of light emitted by different atomic species. The quantum theory of the atom developed as an explanation for the electron's staying in its orbital, which could not be explained by Newton's laws of motion and by classical electromagnetism.\nhope this helps u out....\nhave a great day......"

107,2,"The eggs are formed in the gonads of the females, that is, in the ovaries. They pass through the oviducts, where different protective layers are added, and finally go out of the female's body through the cloaca, an opening that is anterior to the tail (if they have one). \nThe cloaca also receives the end products of the digestive system (i.e. the feces) and the kidneys (i.e. the urine). \nThis process is common to all tetrapods (amphibians, ""reptiles"", birds and egg-laying mammals).\n\nWhat happens to the unfertilized egg within the oviduct is very different in amphibians and reptiles. If you're not interested, you may stop reading here ;-)\n\n************************** \nMost amphibians have external fertilization. This means that while the egg is inside the mother's body, it is still an undeveloped ovum. In some amphibian females (especially frogs and toads) the eggs are so abundant that they fill most of her abdominal cavity before they're released. They are usually released into water bodies, and the male fertilizes them as they come out. \n\nIn cecilians (legless amphibians), the males do have a copulatory organ (which acts as a penis) and fertilization of the eggs occurs within the mother's body. Some of them are oviparous and lay already-fertilized eggs, but others are viviparous.\n\nIn the case of newts and salamanders, fertilization can happen in the mother's oviduct because the males produce ""sperm packages"" called spermatophores, which the female takes with her cloaca. Then the eggs come out already fertilized; but there are also ovoviviparous and viviparous forms.\n\n****************\nNow, reptiles are a different story. Like us mammals, they are Amniotes, which means that their eggs (as those of birds and egg-laying mammals), come out of the female body already fertilized and well on their way to development. The amniote egg is a closed ""survival module"" that has everything the embryo needs to survive and develop: food (the vitellum, or egg yolk), water, calcium for its bones, an air chamber, etc. encased in a tough  cover (frequently calcified). \nThis means that fertilization must occur _before_ the egg is laid, while the ovum is travelling along the oviduct. All amniotes have internal fertilization, and male reptiles have a penis (turtles and crocs) or paired hemipenes (lizards and snakes). \n\nTo sum up, both groups lay their eggs through the cloacal opening, but amphibian eggs need water or at least moistness to survive, because they don't have the embryonic membranes of amniotes and they lose water fast. Amphibian eggs usually don't have much food either, and the embryos hatch as larvae or tadpoles that eat by themselves. In contrast, reptile embryos grow inside their extraembryonic membranes and hatch as mini-adults."

115,2,"A Nonlinear Program (NLP) is a problem that can be put into the form\n\n    minimize   F(x)\n\n    subject to gi(x)  = 0    for i = 1, ..., m1       where m1 >= 0\n               hj(x) >= 0    for j = m1+1, ..., m     where m >= m1\n\nThat is, there is one scalar-valued function F, of several variables (x here is a vector), that we seek to minimize subject (perhaps) to one or more other such functions that serve to limit or define the values of these variables. F is called the ""objective function"", while the various other functions are called the ""constraints"". (If maximization is sought, it is trivial to do so, by multiplying F by -1.)\n\nBecause NLP is a difficult field, researchers have identified special cases for study. A particularly well studied case is the one where all the constraints g and h are linear. The name for such a problem, unsurprisingly, is ""linearly constrained optimization"". If, as well, the objective function is quadratic at most, this problem is called Quadratic Programming (QP). An even more special case of great importance is where the objective function and the constraints are entirely linear; this is called Linear Programming (LP) and is discussed in a separate FAQ list. Another important special case, called unconstrained optimization, is where there are no constraints at all.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges in NLP is that some problems exhibit ""local optima""; that is, spurious solutions that merely satisfy the requirements on the derivatives of the functions. Think of a near-sighted mountain climber in a terrain with multiple peaks, and you'll see the difficulty posed for an algorithm that tries to move from point to point only by climbing uphill. Algorithms that propose to overcome this difficulty are termed ""Global Optimization"".\n\nThe word ""Programming"" is used here in the sense of ""planning""; the necessary relationship to computer programming was incidental to the choice of name. Hence the phrase ""NLP program"" to refer to a piece of software is not a redundancy, although I tend to use the term ""code"" instead of ""program"" to avoid the possible ambiguity. \n\nThe sites below are quite good. If you want a career in Operations Research or Retailing Management, NLP is a gr8 plus to learn"
116,2,"Carl Linnaeus: He was the founder of the Modern Botany and the most lauded botanist of all time. He was born in Sweden in 1707. He traveled throughout Europe and America, collected thousands of plants and described them in great details.          He wrote numerous botanical works. Amongst these, Species Plantarum (Don’t confuse with Planetarium that deals with stars and planets.) published in 1753.\nHe was first to introduce Binary Nomenclature or the binomial nomenclature for all the living things. In this method, each of the living beings is known by a single scientific name through out the world to avoid any confusion in communication. The name itself consists of two parts. First is the generic name and the second is the specific name, hence the name binomial nomenclature. This method is in operational practice even today. (i.e. more than two centuries!). All human beings in the world are Homo sapiens (man the clever one). These names are written in italics, the generic name begins with a capital letter and the specific one with a small letter.\n     The other contribution of this great botanist is regarding the classification of living plants. He introduced Sexual System of plant classification. The basic principle of the system is as follows:-\nIn order to adapt themselves to the changed environment, plants may change their outward form or morphology, but; when it comes to reproduction, they are more conservative or orthodox and do not change the process of reproduction so easily.\n     If, therefore, the system of classification is based on their salient modes of reproduction then it will have a very sound base.\n     This reasoning is so accurate that all the systems of plant classification that are in vogue in different parts of the world are based on this principle only.\n      Thus, Carl Linnaeus will eternally be remembered in the scientific world for his Binomial Nomenclature and Sexual System of Plant Classification.\n      The Linnaean Society in London was founded in 1788 to honour him."

Moreover g changes negligibily during the course of the movement through that 7 m also. \n2. resistance due to friction, air resistance are completely absent\n\nIt is also important to note that once a force slightly greater than 68.6 newtons is applied, the body starts moving upwards and keeps moving until an opposing force is applied. so to move through exactly 7m, u need to apply a force in the opposite direction to stop the object"

It moves the air particles at the end of the barrel in random ways, by expulsion of the combusted gun powder gasses and by the movement of the bullet. \n\nThe first reason of the sound is uncontrolled expansion of gasses at the end of the barrel, that cause air particle to vibrate at various frequencies for a short time, while gasses move them apart from one antoher.\n\nThe second reason is the bullet breaking the sound barrier when exiting the barrel. It's average velocity is 450 m/s up to 1200 m/s. If speed of sound at 20oC and 1 atm is cca 340 m/s, it is clear that sound barrier is broken, which causes ""boom"".\n\nSo, mixture of those two sounds make sound of a gun fire."

If you have a camera with the capability of a very long exposure, you take a picture of the sky over the course of a few hours.  When the picture is developed, you wont see just points of light, but rather streaks across the sky as the stars moved every so slightly.\nAlso, as the Earth revolves around the run throughout the year, certain stars become visible and others not based on out position in the solar system.  Some constellations can only be seen during the summer/winter since the Earth is located on the opposite side of the sun during those times."

I think what you'd need to do is wipe your hands down with alcohol and have a source of bacteria (a piece of raw chicken could work) that you rub your hands on each time.  I would imagine something like: rinse your hands with ethanol (to kill whatever is already there), touch the bacteria source, wipe your fingers on a control plate (if you don't have proper aguar plates, you can use chicken broth as per the experiment above), wash your hands with the soap to be tested, and wipe your hands on another plate.

As soon as spacetime ended you'd come to a stop; the physics of movement would not work anymore. Within an imperceptible fragment of a second the edge of the universe would catch back up to you and you'd be sitting there wondering what happened (if you noticed anything at all).

For each factor, we need to choose a power of 2 between 0 and a1, a power of 3 between 0 and a2.., ie a total of (a1+1)(a2+1)(a3+1)... choices.\n\nIn this case, we need exactly 7 factors (5, plus 1 and itself), and the only way to make 7 out of a product like that is to make a1 = 6 (since we want the smallest, no need to choose a2 etc).\n\n(Note that it is *NOT* 2^(n+1) for n positive integers in general, as one answerer said. Take n = 7, say (where we want 9 factors). Its much better to choose a1 = 2, a2 = 2 to get 36, as opposed to taking a1 = 8 to get 256.)\n\nReplying to Jud: Sorry, I made a mistake. a1 = 2, a2 = 2 gives 36 as the smallest number with 7 factors other than 1: 2,3,4,6,9,12,18.\n256 is quite a bit higher than that :)"

193,2,"Glycerol is used as a cryoprotectant at concentrations of between 5 and 20% for a number of reasons. Firstly, however, you need to know why a cryoprotectant is needed at all... Cells would otherwise be in some type of buffer and media, which if frozen, would cause ice formation inside and outside the cells, causing their death due to various reasnons including the freezing and non-freezing of solutes causing local increases in concentration, and ice crystals can cause rupture of membranes, as well as some other effects. Glycerol is therefore used as a cryoprotectant which allows for vitrification to occur, which is basically the lowering of the freezing temperature of the solutin as well as the increasing of its viscosity. This process prevents crystallization (ie. the ice crystals which are harmful to the cells). Obviously there are a number of cryoprotectants, but glycerol is cheap, fairly non-toxic to the cells, and since it is a polyol, provides some nutrient value to the cells."

226,3,"Well, I was actually listening to a talk radio the other day and someone called in and asked almost the same question.  Blood in urine, no pain.  Basically the doctor told him to go to the doctor and have his kidney's checked.  Go to a doctor that does that for a living, not just a family doctor.  He said to go to a specialist who looks at internal organs.  He also asked if the man had ever been hit in the kidneys, like when he was younger and the man said that kidney punches were the thing back then.  Maybe an idea to check out the kidneys.  Good Luck."
227,3,"There are several types of eczema. I have the type you describe on your son's hands and feet. Moisturize at least twice a day with a non-scented cream (not lotion) like Eucerin or Cetaphil or a generic equivalent.\n\nProvide them with a mild cleansing bar, such as Dove sensitive, for bathing and hand washing. Most people with eczema are very sensitive to chemicals, so apply their sunscreen and such yourself, avoiding the areas with eczema. They should avoid exposing the affected areas to very hot water, as it makes the itch unbearable.\n\nChildren's Benadryl, orally, can help with severe itching, and eczema can cause really severe itching, but it may make them sleepy. Running cool water over the affected area helps a lot. I have not found that topical Benadryl creams help much. Aveeno oatmeal products are highly recommended, but they don't help me. They're worth a try, though. Actually, the cool water helps more than anything, but it stops working when the area warms up again.\n\nOver the counter cortisone creams may treat the rash, but their doc may need to prescribe something stronger. (And I'm not sure they're recommended for children.) They shouldn't wash dishes without gloves, or mess around in other chemicals when they are having a flare up.\n\nMany kids outgrow eczema. Unfortunately, we don't all <pout>\n\n***EDIT***\n\nI almost forgot! Sunshine (not too much of course) helps many eczema sufferers. Expose the affected area for 10-15 minutes a day. I'm kinda weird about getting too hot, but many people get quite a bit of relief from sunshine. Again, it's worth a try."

234,3,"Typically the bacterial infections (chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and trichomoniasis) take anywhere from a few days to a month to show symptoms, if they show symptoms at all! Most of these won't show symptoms for a few months, so someone could be spreading it without knowing they are doing so. FYI - trich doesn't show symptoms in men most of the time, only women. \n\nThe viral infections are different. Herpes, HPV (genital warts), HIV/AIDS, and Hepatitis are all viral STD infections. Herpes and HPV usually show symptoms within a month, while HIV and Hepatitis don't typically show symptoms - sometimes for years at a time. The only specific testing information I know is for HIV - it takes about 3 months before a test can MOST EFFECTIVELY detect a level of antibodies in your system. If you are worried about HIV infection, make sure that you abstain from any risk behaviors (unprotected sex, sharing needles, or unprotected contact with blood, breast milk, vaginal secretions, or semen)  for 3 months before getting tested. \n\nIf you're worried about any STD exposure, go to a doctor or clinic and get tested. They will talk to you about your risk behaviors/level and they will be able to answer more specific questions for you. \n\nBest wishes!"
235,3,"Seasonal Defense (90) \nPowerful Immune Support\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDescription: Seasonal changes can be quite stressful to the body. That's why it is important to support your immune system. Seasonal Defense combines andrographis with other immune-supporting herbs, including Fructus aurantia (six percent synephrine extract), thyme, oregano and eleuthero root for complete immune support.\n\nAndrographis has been used for centuries by many cultures. It is used widely in Ayurvedic medicine and is considered a “cold property” herb in traditional Chinese approaches; it is used to rid the body of “heat” and dispel toxins. Andrographis supports the immune system by promoting both specific and non-specific immune-response functions as well as maintaining the muscles in the respiratory system. Other studies show that synephrine may be able to help maintain the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract and that thyme and eleuthero root both have beneficial properties.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBenefits: \n•  Helps the body defend against seasonal changes. \n•  Contains andrographis to help boost the immune system. \n•  Helps support mucous membrane health. \n \nPurchase Information \nSEASONAL DEFENSE (90)  \nStock No.:806-6 \nQV: 12.40 \nMember Cost: $12.40\nNon-Member Cost: $18.60  \n\n\nhttp://www.mynsp.com/lifemoreabundantlyinc/products/guide.aspx?stockNum=8066\n\n\nI definitely stand by this stuff!!!!!

262,3,"What is depression?\nDepression is a mood disorder that causes you to feel sad or hopeless for an extended period of time. More than just a bout of ""the blues"" or temporary feelings of grief or low energy, depression can have a significant impact on your enjoyment of life, your work, your health, and the people you care about. \n\nDepression affects people differently. Some feel down for extended periods of time; for others the feelings of depression come and go. If you have short episodes of mild depression, you may be able to continue to work and take care of daily activities. However, if you do not seek some form of treatment for your depression, you are at risk for getting more depressed or becoming physically ill. In severe cases, depression can cause people to become incapable of communicating, unable to do routine activities, or suicidal. In these cases, it is essential to seek medical attention.\n\nPeople with depression may be reluctant to seek help because they feel that it is a sign of personal weakness or a character flaw or that they should be able to ""pull out of it"" on their own. We now know that depression, like other medical conditions, has a chemical and biological basis. Treatment for depression is safe and usually effective even for severely depressed people.\n\nIf you think you may have depression, take a short quiz to evaluate your symptoms:\n\nInteractive Tool: Are you depressed? \nWhat causes depression?\nDepression may be triggered by stressful life events, other illnesses, certain drugs or medications, or inherited traits. Although causes of depression are not entirely understood, we know it is linked to an imbalance in brain chemistry. Once the imbalance is corrected, symptoms of depression generally improve.\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\nDepression is more than just the normal, temporary feelings of sadness and hopelessness associated with difficult life events. The symptoms of depression are often subtle at first. It can be hard to recognize that symptoms may be connected and that you might have depression. Common symptoms include:\n\nDepressed mood. \nInability to enjoy activities. \nProblems concentrating. \nChanges in eating habits or appetite. \nWeight gain or weight loss. \nChanges in sleeping habits. \nDifficulty going to work or taking care of your daily responsibilities because of a lack of energy. \nFeelings of guilt and hopelessness; wondering if life is worth living (common). \nSlowed thoughts and speech. \nPreoccupation with thoughts of death or suicide. \nComplaints that have no physical cause (somatic complaints) such as headache and stomachache. \nAll of these symptoms can interfere with your quality of life. Even if you don't have major depression, if you have experienced a few of these symptoms for at least 2 weeks you may have a less severe form of depression that still requires treatment.\n\nHow is it treated?\nDepression is usually treated successfully with professional counseling, antidepressant medication, or a combination of the two. Often a combination of the two is most effective. People with depression usually can be treated as outpatients, but in severe cases a period of hospitalization may be necessary.\n\nIf you have mild or moderate depression, you may be diagnosed and treated by your family health professional and a therapist or psychologist. If you have severe depression or other psychological disorders or do not respond to treatment, a psychiatrist, a doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of mental health problems, may be helpful.\n\nLet your health professional know if you suspect that you have depression, because it is often overlooked. If you are diagnosed with depression, you and your health professional can decide on the best treatment. The earlier you are treated, the more quickly you will recover. 1 \n\nHow common is depression?\nIf you have symptoms of depression, you are not alone. In the United States, an estimated 15% "

335,4,"American novelist and short story writer. Salinger published one novel and several short story collections between 1948-59. His best-known work is THE CATCHER IN THE RYE (1951), a story about a rebellious teenage schoolboy and his quixotic experiences in New York. \n\nJ.D. Salinger was born and grew up in the fashionable apartment district of Manhattan, New York. He was the son of a prosperous Jewish importer of Kosher cheese and his Scotch-Irish wife. In his childhood the young Jerome was called Sonny. The family had a beautiful apartment on Park Avenue. After restless studies in prep schools, he was sent to Valley Forge Military Academy (1934-36), which he attended briefly. His friends from this period remember his sarcastic wit. In 1937 when he was eighteen and nineteen, Salinger spent five months in Europe. From 1937 to 1938 he studied at Ursinus College and New York University. He fell in love with Oona O'Neill, wrote her letters almost daily, and was later shocked when she married Charles Chaplin, who was much older than she. \n\nIn 1939 Salinger took a class in short story writing at Columbia University under Whit Burnett, founder-editor of the Story Magazine. During World War II he was drafted into the infantry and was involved in the invasion of Normandy. Salinger's comrades considered him very brave, a genuine hero. During the first months in Europe Salinger managed to write stories and in Paris meet Ernest Hemingway. He was also involved in one of the bloodiest episodes of the war in Hürtgenwald, a useless battle, where he witnessed the horrors of war. \n\nIn his celebrated story 'For Esmé - With Love and Squalor' Salinger depicted a fatigued American soldier. He starts a correspondence with a thirteen-year-old British girl, which helps him to get a grip of life again. Salinger himself was hospitalized for stress according to his biographer Ian Hamilton. After serving in the Army Signal Corps and Counter-Intelligence Corps from 1942 to 1946, he devoted himself to writing. He played poker with other aspiring writers, but was considered a sour character who won all the time. He considered Hemingway and Steinbeck second rate writers but praised Melville. In 1945 Salinger married a French woman named Sylvia - she was a doctor. They were later divorced and in 1955 Salinger married Claire Douglas, the daughter of the British art critic Robert Langton Douglas. The marriage ended in divorce in 1967, when Salinger's retreat into his private world and Zen Buddhism only increased. \n\nSalinger's early short stories appeared in such magazines as Story, where his first story was published in 1940, Saturday Evening Post and Esquire, and then in the New Yorker, which published almost all of his later texts. In 1948 'A Perfect Day for Bananafish' appeared, which introduced Seymour Glass, who commits suicide. It was the earliest reference to the Glass family, whose stories would go on to form the main corpus of his writing. The 'Glass cycle' continued in the collections FRANNY AND ZOOEY (1961), RAISE HIGH THE ROOF BEAM, CARPENTERS (1963) and SEYMOUR: AN INTRODUCTION (1963). Several of the stories are narrated by Buddy Glass. 'Hapworth 16, 1924' is written in the form of a letter from summer camp, in which the seven-year-old Seymour draws a portrait of him and his younger brother Buddy. ""When I look back, listen back, over the half-dozen or slightly more original poets we've had in America, as well as the numerous talented eccentric poets and - in modern times, especially - the many gifted style deviates, I feel something close to a conviction that we have only three or four very nearly nonexpendable poets, and I think Seymour will eventually stand with those few.""

Be familiar with each faculty member's current work.  If you don't have time to read it all before your interview, at least get familiar with the specific research interests of each person.  (You probably know some of this already, since you applied to the program, and hope to have one or two of these people as mentors in your field of specialization.)\n\nBottom line:  Look at the interview as an opportunity for a good, productive conversation between you and the faculty.

382,4,"Analysis\nThe poem is an attack on the bigotry and hypocrisy of the Kirk (Church), as told by the (fictional) self-justifying prayer of a (real) kirk elder, Holy Willie. Throughout the poem, Holy Willie condemns himself as a hypocrite while simultaneously asking God to judge harshly and show no mercy to his fellow transgressors. Burns used the example of Holy Willie to make the point that the Calvinist theology underpinning the entire Kirk was equally hypocritical.\n\nThe Kirk was still a powerful moral force in Burns' day, and one which he believed he had a justified grievance against. Burns felt that belief in predestination, whether to salvation or damnation, could only make people morally reckless, because logically their actions could have no influence on their eternal fate. He observed that belief in predestination, particularly to salvation, had the additional tendency to make people insufferably self-righteous. It is this last tendency in particular, and the more general theological and moral sterility embodied in the teachings of the contemporary Kirk, that he rails against very effectively in this work.\n\nWillie's soapy sanctimony is alternated with his self-justifying tales of his own fornication and other transgressions with very great skill. The characters are drawn from real life, with no names being changed.\n\nIn The Book of Ebenezer Le Page, 'Holy Willie' is used as a term of abuse for insincere clerics."

Plus, when you download stuff off Limewire, it could be the real thing or it could be a virus.\n\nThe GIMP is really a far safer approach.

462,5,"An emoticon, also called a smiley, is a sequence of ordinary printable ASCII characters, such as :-), ;o), ^_^ or :-(, or a small image, intended to represent a human facial expression and convey an emotion. Emoticons are a form of paralanguage commonly used in e-mail messages, in online bulletin boards, online forums, instant messengers, or in chat rooms, without them simple statements could be misinterpreted. Sometime during 1981, Scott Fahlman (now a Principle Research Scientist in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University), devised a scheme for encoding and conveying one's feelings in small text ""glyphs"" to overcome this frustration.\n\nLook up emoticon in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.The word emoticon is a portmanteau which popular etymology bases on emotion and icon. A similar portmanteau, verticon (based on vertical and (i?)con), is sometimes used when referring to the East Asian style of emoticon.\n\nThe smile is represented with a basic smiley :-). The colon represents the eyes, the hyphen is for the nose, and the parenthesis is for the mouth.\n\nMany variants exist with different symbols substituted for the basic ones. The symbol for the nose is often omitted, for example :) or ;). When the colon is replaced with the equals sign, =), the nose is almost always omitted (so one would not see =-), for example)."

481,5,"An expert system is a class of computer programs developed by researchers in artificial intelligence during the 1970s and applied commercially throughout the 1980s. In essence, they are programs made up of a set of rules that analyze information (usually supplied by the user of the system) about a specific class of problems, as well as provide analysis of the problem(s), and, depending upon their design, recommend a course of user action in order to implement corrections.\n\nTypically, the problems to be solved are of the sort that would normally be tackled by a human ""expert""—a medical or other professional, in most cases. Real experts in the problem domain (which will typically be very narrow, for instance ""diagnosing skin diseases in human teenagers"") are asked to provide ""rules of thumb"" on how they evaluate the problems, either explicitly with the aid of experienced system developers, or sometimes implicitly, by getting such experts to evaluate test cases and using computer programs to examine the test data and (in a strictly limited manner) derive rules from that. Generally expert systems are used for problems for which there is no single ""correct"" solution which can be encoded in a conventional algorithm — one would not write an expert system to find shortest paths through graphs, or sort data, as there are simply easier ways to do these tasks.\n\nSimple systems use simple true/false logic to evaluate data, but more sophisticated systems are capable of performing at least some evaluation taking into account real-world uncertainties, using such methods as fuzzy logic. Such sophistication is difficult to develop and still highly imperfect"
482,5,"There are about 1.5 billion emails being sent around the around EVERYday. 70% of them are spam mails. The only thing we can do is try to ignore them and report them as spam mail. The problem with spam mail is that people just delete them, they dont report them. Everytime you get a spam mail, you can report it so that your ISP or Firewall or Security Suite can find out how they can block those mails. The more spam mail you send them, the better they can filter them out. It is very difficult to try and block every spam mail existing out there, but I think if everyone shows effort to report them, then maybe theres a chance that they can improve the security to block them. There might be emails that you get that I dont get, but I might get them a few months later. If your email helps block future spam emails, then it will help so much....it would be like a domino effect. \n\nThats the role we need to play. We need to report them and act like spam patrols and help eliminate them once and for all. We shouldnt just ignore them and delete them....its easier to point and click than to report the problem.

If you have done a lot of these, just fragment your hard drive and that will clean up the fragmentation, just not the files themselves."

492,5,The Microsoft Movie Maker (Built into XP) can probably get that down to size for you.  But a file that large will take a lot of time to compress to another type of file.  But to actually burn it to a DVD and watch it on a normal DVD Player (not PC in other words) You'll have to use a different piece of software.  I use Roxio's Easy Media Creator Home myself.  But if you do some searches on Google or Yahoo you might find something to your liking.  As for how to actuall acomplish your task with Roxio or Movie Maker.. you'll just have to read the tutorials in Movie Maker or the Manual of Roxio or whatever software you choose.

538,6,"Generally a shift refers not just to a player, though, but the whole line, or defensive pair.\n\nPlayers generally come on and off in lines, and your three forwards (left wing, right wing and center) will generally come out together, work a ""shift"" together and come back off the ice more or less at the same time (unless as usual your left wing's still doggedly chasing their center around the offensive net and won't let him come out for love or money).  \n\n""Double shifting"" means you're putting one player out on one more shift per rotation through the bench than he'd usually play.  So say I played with Line 1, and then Line 2 went out and then instead of the regular center on Line 3, the coach put me in again.\n\nIn rec hockey you might do it because you're missing a player (like you have two lines of three and one line of two).\n\nIn pro hockey it means you're desperate to get a certain individual out there because he's producing, but the wisdom of that is debatable except in isolated cases.  Double shifting is extremely tiring.  On the bench, you tend to need every second of rest you get.\n\nDefense works in shifts too.  A defensive pair (whichever combination the coach sends out) on the ice is also doing a ""shift,"" which ends when they both come off.\n\nShifts should be kept short.  The idea is to go out there, give it everything you have until you're cooked and then get off the ice again."
539,6,"ARGENTINA, no doubt. They really play as a team, without selfishness. They have amazingly skillful players, even on the bench. The members of the team are very close.

So that you can shift your weight back a lot, and also so you can jump off the back easily if you need to\n\nAlso tell the people at the bike shop what sort of riding you intend to do they would be able to give you further advice."

602,7,"Don't take it personally.  The national average is 8 months between jobs, whether a person was terminated, laid off, or left on their own.  Some things to take inventory of are:  How many resumes have you sent out or job applications that you have filled out?  And of those, how many resulted in an interview?  That is a good indicator of how effective you are.  If the ratio is 5 - 8 interviews to 20 resumes/apps. filled out, then that is good.  Just keep plugging along.  If it is lower than that, then you need to look at what you are doing.  Another thing is to exhaust all your resources.  Network with friends and family.  That is the number one way to find a job."
603,7,"You never know when the reference for this job will be needed...what do you want them to say about you?

604,7,"Knew someone who worked for the Post Office in the United States and based on this fact I would say that you need to inquire of the Post Office what skills they are looking for.  Then based on the information you are able to gather I would say practice those skills for a period of time.  In the case of working for the Post Office here the hopeful job applicant must take a test and if the job applied for is one of a delivery Postman then you will be tested on where addresses are located.  Additionally it helps if you can supply previous work experience information that shows your ability to be punctual (on time) and any other information they might be seeking.\n\nMight add here that the delivery Postman only needs to know his particular route.  If you are chosen to work inside the Post Office, then you will have to learn all of the routes because you will be one of the people who sorts the mail for all of the mail carriers (delivery Postmen)."

Questions like this are also serious enough to make us stop and think. That helps a great deal as well. We all need to approach every question realizing that no matter how odd it is, someone with a heart wrote it. We have to use tact......we have to treat all just like we would if we were all socializing at a party and discussing issues together. Yes, the avatars are 'cutsy' instead of true depictions of us.

Life is to short to be un happy, and if you're like me then you have to do whatcha have to do to pay your bills.  So when you go to\nfeeling unwanted or uncomfortable, think of how it feels to be unemployed and broke you will change your mind and just think of your co-workers as non existent. You have to live for you and just keep on moving cuz' if you run now you'll never stop runnin' but by all means just try and stick it out and see if things change cuz it is not guaranteed that your next job will be better.

610,7,"Thanks for asking! I am a business librarian, so I will consult Hoovers Business Database to find your answer:\n\nPan American Airways represents the latest effort to keep the storied ""Pan Am"" name aloft. The company was formed in 1998 when New England railroad operator Guilford Transportation Industries bought bankrupt Pan American World Airways. That air carrier had acquired the rights to the name of the original Pan Am, which folded in 1991.\n\nThese days Pan American Airways offers service under the Pan Am Clipper Connection brand in the eastern US and Puerto Rico. The carrier's flights have been operated by affiliate Boston-Maine Airways since Pan American Airways fired its unionized pilots and shut down its own flight operations in 2004."

614,7,"Why would anyone create such a list?  The note holders would have to be the ones to create such a list, why would they do that?  Now, for real estate notes, the act of recording the mortgage lists the original note holder, but it is common that the actual note holder is not the one listed in the public record.  The credit bureaus will sell that public record information, but it will not be accurate.\n\nThe reason is this.  Imagine that GMAC Mortgage makes a loan to someone.  The record will show the owner as GMAC Mortgage.  However they will then participate the note out to others.  The contract may or may not be recorded in the public record.  Further, if it is held for a trust indenture, none of the actual holders will ever be known except in the case of a bankruptcy of the indenture trustee.\n\nFinally, for private issuers, your ability to assess the quality of the note will be negligable.  You should treat such notes as junk quality as they were not able to get ordinary underwriting."

635,7,"Advantages of Mutual Funds\n\n\nThe advantages of investing in a Mutual Fund are:\n\n    * Diversification: The best mutual funds design their portfolios so individual investments will react differently to the same economic conditions. For example, economic conditions like a rise in interest rates may cause certain securities in a diversified portfolio to decrease in value. Other securities in the portfolio will respond to the same economic conditions by increasing in value. When a portfolio is balanced in this way, the value of the overall portfolio should gradually increase over time, even if some securities lose value.\n\n    * Professional Management:Most mutual funds pay topflight professionals to manage their investments. These managers decide what securities the fund will buy and sell.\n\n    * Regulatory oversight: Mutual funds are subject to many government regulations that protect investors from fraud.\n\n    * Liquidity: It's easy to get your money out of a mutual fund. Write a check, make a call, and you've got the cash.\n\n    * Convenience: You can usually buy mutual fund shares by mail, phone, or over the Internet.\n\n    * Low cost: Mutual fund expenses are often no more than 1.5 percent of your investment. Expenses for Index Funds are less than that, because index funds are not actively managed. Instead, they automatically buy stock in companies that are listed on a specific index\n\n    * Transparency\n\n    * Flexibility\n\n    * Choice of schemes\n\n    * Tax benefits\n\n    * Well regulated"

661,7,"Prices in OC are increasing, but the volume of home sales is down.  In November I bought a condo that was listed for 2 days, now 3 in my complex have been on the market for over 45 days.  \n\nHowever the place I bought was listed $50,000 less then the same model listed by another agent.  By the time the bidding war was over I paid $10K more then the asking price, the other unit for sale was thrashed and sold a month after mine for $5000 less then I paid.  Best way to sell quick is to price VERY LOW, it will get the attention of all buyers looking in your area.  You dont have to accept full price offers.  If you have a good agent they will bluff any single offers.  I have no way of verifying there was ever a bidding war on my condo, just that the sellers agent says he had 3 full price offers.  My mom was my realtor, I had 20% down payment, no home to sell, no contingencies, and I worked for a loan company.  I also put a $20,000 deposit.  In all actuality I doubt a better buyer was making an offer. \n\nRates are going up and people will spend more to borrow the same amount, lowering the amount they can afford.  If a lot of renters occupy your condo complex it may prove a good time to sell.  The owners of rental properties will let investment properties go into foreclosure before they let a primary residence default.  \nAre you moving up, or relocating?

664,7,"I actually have been following and buying this stock for quite some time... i have over 5 thousand shares, and i am very happy with it. they are an up and coming company that deals withwireless donloading, and deal primarily in europe, although i believe they are poised to explode to a global business. what they do is use cellular transmission to download music to a cell phone or wireless computer very fast. if you were to request a song, all the towers in the area would bombard you with data for a very short period of time, like poissibly 10 seconds. you would get parts of the song (or file) from many towers,at one time, and it would build on your phone or device. you can d/l a song in just a few seconds. of course they charge per song... currently, they only work with one music company (BMG recording i think) so there is a somewhat limited catalog of songs to choose. but as they become more broad, and move into more ares, i think they could easily associate with many more music companies. this is a company with the possibility to explode especially in urban areas where cell phone towers are every couple blocks. At 48 cents a share, i believe you cant go wrong. but expect to hold for up to 3 years or so, depending on the growth, it may take a while, you never know. i have bought at as low a i think 41 cents, and i sell if it surges to 75 cents or more. but i never suggest day trading. i think it would be a wise buy and hold stock. My honest expectations for this stock are upwards of 9-10 dollars over the coming years.\n\nhope this helped"

668,7,"So you want to raise funds for your group by having a raffle. Here are some questions that you probably should ask yourself:\n\n - How much money do you want to raise?\n - How much money do you want to spend to raise the amount in the first question?\n - Who will be likely to buy raffle tickets?\n -  How many raffle tickets do we expect to sell?\n\nMany local businesses might be willing to donate merchandise or services as prizes for your raffle in exchange for some advertising. If you are thinking of having lots of small to medium prizes, check with your local Starbucks - they often will give out gift cards for groups as raffle prizes. Also check with smoothie places. For nicer prizes, perhaps companies can donate items for gift baskets - like movie tickets or spa coupons or fancy snacks or gift cards to different local stores. For really high-end prizes, check with car dealerships for cars or travel agents for travel packages.\n\nOnce you have a grand prize or set of prizes, you can price the tickets - perhaps $1 for a chance to win something in the $10-$50 range or upwards of $25 for a chance to win a trip or a car. If you are selling $1 tickets, you can probably get by with just having a cashbox at a booth and a roll of tickets, and just have ""must be present when the number is announced to win"". but for high end prizes, you should probably be able to accept checks, make special custom tickets, and get full contact information for ticket buyers, to let them know if they win.\n\nLocal businesses love to say that they give back to the community, and one way they do that is to donate stuff for community and school groups that raffle off the the stuff for fundraisers. So check with your local businesses - perhaps you might be raffling movie tickets or gift cards for the mall or an iPod or a weekend trip for two to a local resort. make sure you raffle off something that people want. if people aren't interested in your prize, they might not be willing to buy a ticket.\n\ngood luck!"

Free money is good.\n\nIf your company doesn't have matching funds, then fund your Roth IRA to its maximum ($4,000). Tax-free growth is good. I'd go with a no-load, low cost mutual fund company, like Fidelity, Vanguard, or T Rowe Price. If you have money left over after you've funded the 401(k) to the maximum match, do this step with the extra money.\n\nIf you *still* have more money for long-term investing, go back to the 401(k) and invest in that up to what you can afford.\n\nAnd get yourself an elementary education in personal finance. You're going to get a lot advice here, and you won't know who to believe. Well you can believe this: no one is going to care as much about your money as you are. No one is going to watch it as closely as you are, especially someone who's got multiple accounts to look after. So get yourself a foundation, so you'll know if someone is actually giving you good advice or not. Personally, I recommend ""The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need"" by Andrew Tobias.

Unfortunately it is not free. You can get your FICO credit score from Equifax for $7.95 but that is only one credit bureau. \n\nWhen you apply for a mortgage the lender will pull all 3 credit bureaus and ""price"" your loan from the middle score, so you really need to know all 3 of your FICO scores.\n\nOnce you have reviewed your credit reports for accuracy and disputed any items that you believe to be inaccurate you can go to www.myfico.com/12 and get all 3 of your FICO scores for $45.00. This will also give you the top 4 reasons as to why your credit scores aren't higher.\n\nWhen you have all 3 of your FICO credit scores you can do some rate shopping before you apply. www.bankrate.com has calculators to determine what you can afford and in the mortgage section you can see a table of potential lenders with accurate rates in your local area.\n\nAlso go to www.myfico.com and look in the Credit Education section to see how credit scores work.\n\nGood Luck"

However Fire signs also match up well with Gemini and despite what you may have heard, Sagittarius (which is Gemini's Polar Opposite) is a GREAT match if you can learn to make your differences work for you. However be careful with aries and leo who are too arrogant for the tastes of geminis (and most other people too, lol). \nLibra and aquarius are air signs and thus considered perfect matches for gemini. Libras are the only ones who are capable of bending enough for stubborn geminis. Aquarians tend to be a little too suspicious for anything to really come about with gemini. \n\nAll of this is generally speaking of course. There are plenty of websites and books you can consult but keep in mind that everything you read will be generally speaking. Astrology tells you a lot about basic personality but it is highly complex science."

731,8,"The twelve ghosts which make up the Black Zodiac all have their own unique back story, and while these were not described in the film, the production and make-up teams used them as guidelines. All the ghosts were contained in glass prisons, and were caught with the aid of the psychic Rafkin, who could locate them, and on the behalf of Cyrus.\n\n1. The First Born Son (played by Mikhael Speidel)\n\nThe First Born Son is the ghost of a little boy called Billy Michaels, who was obsessed with cowboy films. Not heeding his parents' advice, he played Cowboys and Indians with a real bow and arrow, and the arrow went straight through his forehead.\n\n2. The Torso (played by Daniel Wesley)\n\nThe Torso is the ghost of a gambler called Jimmy Gambino. Losing everything in a poker game, he tried to welch on his bet and escape. The mob, which he owed money to, caught up with Gambino and cut him into several pieces, wrapping them in cellophane and dumping the corpse.\n\n3. The Bound Woman (played by Laura Mennel)\n\nThe Bound Woman was a cheerleader, who was strangled after a high school prom after cheating on her boyfriend. She was strangled by him, and was later found buried on the football field.\n\n4. The Withered Lover (played by Kathryn Anderson)\n\nThe Withered Lover is Jean Kriticos, the wife of Arthur. She died in the freak house fire while trying to rescue her children.\n\n5. The Torn Prince (played by Craig Olejnik)\n\nThe Torn Prince is the ghost of Royce Clayton, who was a baseball star. He challenged a greaser to a drag race and was killed in the ensuing crash.\n\n6. The Angry Princess (played by Shawna Loyer)\n\nThe Angry Princess is Dana Newman, who constantly tried achieving perfection with her looks, despite being beautiful. She gave up eventually and slit her own wrists. She was found with dozens of self-inflicted gashes on her. The movie suggests that she killed herself for another reason (In the scene when she appears in the bathroom, you see the phrase ""I'm sorry"" on the floor in blood). This, however, was probably there to add more drama to the scene and not true.\n\n7. The Pilgrimess (played by Xantha Radley)\n\nThe Pilgrimess is the ghost of Isabella Smith, an English woman who travelled across the Atlantic and settled in New England. She was a separatist, and this isolated her from the other townsfolk. She was found guilty of witchcraft, and put to death in the stocks (pillory).\n\n8. & 9. The Great Child and The Dire Mother (played by C. Ernst Harth and Laurie Soper)\n\nThe Dire Mother is the ghost of Margaret Shelburne, who was imprisoned by a group of lumberjacks, forced to live in a cage as a form of entertainment, due to her being only three feet tall. She had a child with one of the lumberjacks, a son Harold who weighed over 300 pounds (136 kg).\n\nHarold was spoiled by his mother, who raised him to be her protector and to exact revenge on the lumberjacks. Harold took up his father's axe, and was capable of chopping down massive redwoods single-handedly. Eventually he turned the axe on the other lumberjacks, and both he and his mother were killed by a frenzied mob.\n\n10. The Hammer (played by Herbert Duncanson)\n\nThe Hammer is the ghost of a blacksmith, George Markley, who lived in a small town in the 1890s. He was driven out of town after wrongfully being accused of stealing. Enraged, he tracked down the people responsible and hammered them to death. The other townsfolk captured him, and they drove large nails into his body and cut off his hands.\n\n11. The Jackal (played by Shane Wyler)\n\nThe Jackal is Ryan Kuhn, a psychotic mental patient with a penchant for attacking women. He was permanently in a straitjacket, and had a metal cage locked around his head. After years of this, he had grown deformed, and reviled human contact. He was the only victim of a fire that broke out in the asylum; he apparently ran into the flames rather than let anyone touch him.\n\n12. The Juggernaut (playe"

743,8,"Summary of the eRumor\nThis piece of alleged history explains that in the olden days of sailing ships, cannon balls were stacked on the decks on brass plates called ""monkeys.""  The plates had indentions in them that held the balls on the bottoms of the stacks.  Brass, however, expands and contracts with the temperature and if it got cold enough, the cannon balls could fall...giving real foundation to the phrase ""cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey!""  \n \n \n The Truth\nAccording to the United States Navy Historical Center, this is a legend of the sea without historical justification.  The center has researched this because of the questions it gets and says the term ""brass monkey"" and a vulgar reference to the effect of cold on the monkey's extremities, appears to have originated in the book ""Before the Mast"" by C.A. Abbey.  It was said that it was so cold that it would ""freeze the tail off a brass monkey.""   The Navy says there is no evidence that the phrase had anything to do with ships or ships with cannon balls."

Each vegetable is so sweet and delicious that any melange seemed like a banquet and they practically required no seasoning, perhaps just a bit of steam and some cold pressed olive oil.  Hence I see salad days as that which is youthful, fresh, filled with flavor and the innocence by which youth will always be oblivious of the hardships and heavy responsibilities yet to come."

Once again, Johnny came to the rescue and stuck her again. 'JESUS CHRIST!"" shouted April and the teacher said, ""very good,"" and April fell back to sleep. \n\nThen the teacher asked April a third question. ""What did Eve say to Adam after she had her twenty-third child?"" And again, Johnny jabbed her with the pin.

I remember that in the beginning of Katie & Tom's relationship, it was reported that there was some sort of argument/disagreement/unpleasant talk between the 2 of them when Nicole called Tom's house once to talk to her 2 kids, Isabella & Connor, but Katie answered the phone.  But regardless, it has been said that Nicole wishes the newlyweds the best and a lifetime of happiness.  After all, Nicole is the children's mother and Katie is their step-mother, so they do have to get along.  At least, they are not having an ugly, nasty public feud like some people."

I almost lost her at one point and i hope that I can work out my problems so i never chance that again."

When I finally left for good and divorced him, I met the most amazing man ever. We are now living together and engaged.\n\nHe really knows how to treat a woman like a woman, rather than a piece of meat or crap. He treats me with kindness, love, and respect, cherishes me, treas me like a God and has me on a pedestal, like I do him. We have soooooooo many things in common it still amazes me. We have just enough not in common to keep things interesting. He works long hours on a farm; I am currently unemployed but looking for a job. He has no problem supporting me during this time. We have great communication and the sex is totally awesome, amazing, fantastic, and all that--just like the whole relationship. I have never had anyone like this in my life, or treat me so great.

829,9,It's not age that matters its how much they know about life and how much they can handle. If you think you're ready for marriage and kids then babysit for a weekend and have your partner help you. You can learn how each other would be with kids and responsibilities. It also has alot to do with the maturity level and maturity only comes with time and lifes experiences.
830,9,"If you have no money, and they love you, then it's obvious that's better... Disaster can easily take each, your love, or your money away, the only difference is money can be garnered again, but will you ever have opportunity to love that person in this world if they die first?\n\nEverything must be valued, but only in its proper degree, since loving something like money over people is sure to leave you less well off than if you love and care for people so much, that with the friends you gain from it, they'll always be glad to help you out too.\n\nMoney can't really give back like that, since you work to acquire it, but it's other people that make the product or do the service you want to buy with it, so it's always people's value that's traded, never money in itself. \n\nThis can be done without money in just working for them, and they'll help out, so the benefits of both love and money are evident with love, but money hides the value of love from you. Even if someone loves you with your focus on money how will you observe truly what you're not focused on? So with a focus on money true love will always pass you by.\n\nMoney itself is worthless, except it's an agreeable trade between you and what you do value, which is always what others provide for that money, and since we all need that, with or without monetary existence, we love people, and never money - no matter how it may appear superfiscally. ;)"
831,9,I didn't know there was such a thing.  Sounds like a good idea though......
832,9,Thats sooo sweet !!! of course you should e-mail him . Why not ? It is so hard to find guys that are  romantic anymore . I say go for it whats the worst that can happen . I do suggest however that if you do not actually know him well that you only meet him in a public place .
833,9,"Its normal to feel that way after heartache. But what happens if you don't do anything? Do you really want to always wonder if you let Mr. Right slip through your fingers? Its ok to love again. If you truly like him and its no just rebounding, go for it! Just date, get time to know this guy. Work on the friendship part. Hold off on intimacy. If he's really into you, he'll want to learn about you, and not just try to get into your pants. If its been a year of dating and he's still there, that is a guy that is interested in you more than sex! And totally sounds like a keeper. He prolly knows you just got hurt. Go slow, but go with him. Don't let the hurt from your ex hold you back. That is giving him control, and I know you don't want that! Hide in your house for a day. Morn that first love that went bad. Then wake up the next day with all of that behind you. Think positive things whenever you start feeling sad. Remind yourself that its just gonna get better. Start living for today, not letting yesterday hold you back."
834,9,wats to complain about? its so much fun!!
835,9,"1. yes guys like to look at porn. and no I still think my wife is beautiful.\n\n2. Porn stimulates fantasy in our heads guys are more visual and by watching or seeing porn it's easier for us to imagin it. It does turn us on and when we are turned on our mates are even more desirerable.\n\n3. Many women feel threatened or undesirable to there guy if they look at porn. That's normal. But that's not the case. You are very desirerable, it just that guys think about sex so much that we know it's unreasonalbe to think that you can be there for us with every urge we have, and porn it sort of an outlet for our over sexxed minds.\n\n4. Not usually. Sometimes we will compair the things you do for us but for the most part no. We might see something or think of something we would like to try because of porn but were coming to you to try it. We would hope that you would be willing to at least try. That alone is a huge turn on for us.\n\n5. It doen't take much. Most guys aren't that dense. We know. But at the same time you need to understand that it's not only a mental desire it's also a physical need for us. being stimulated both mentaly and physically has possitive benifical aspects for us. The hormones and chemicals that our body produces help us with stress, depression and many other things. That being said, although not as extreem, it's sort of like needing to eat. Needing food.\n\n6. Go with it, try and get over it and even enjoy it with him. Be open to it, and let him know you are there for him when he needs you.\n\n7. There are many double standards in this world when it comes to the differant genders. I personally think that if a guy looks at porn he should not get upset if his girl does the same."

838,9,"well it depends, especially for me.  Some boi who is very ugly can probably sweep me off my feet, with his personality. I like those down to earth boys,big flirt (especially if they like me they'll tell it im their actions)by flirting.  Someone whose not scared to cry. Has to have a body! Cant be 5'6 or shorter(cause that's short) Nice smile, when I look into his eyes I feel something. When you look into a girls' eyes and would love to stay there then at that time, that moment you like her, and if she's staring the same way back at you she likes you.  Remember any guy can sweep any girl off her feet- he just needs the right broom. My work here is done, toodles!"

842,9,"I used to be that way.\n\nYou just need to start being friendly with more people,and then you'll realize that getting that kind of attention is not so bad. And you can try something like a fun public speaking class, or hang around friends who bring out the best in you. Others will see you shine, and pretty soon, you'll be able to be yourself around a lot more people! It just takes time. :)"
843,9,"I think to incorporate an ""in memory"" favor would be in poor taste.  I think the idea is very heartfelt and sincere, but not appropriate for a wedding favor.  The idea of a favor is to provide you guest with a memento from YOUR special day. I can understand why it is important to include her in some way, and I think it's important that you do. Have you considered acknowledging  her in another way?? Maybe a toast, special dance, or something like that?  Good luck."

It's actually a pretty good article but I won't clog up answers with the whole thing.  Pick up a copy its on pages 188-190.  There's a lot of other good articles and beauty advice too.
849,9,"It's hard, but some time apart to digest what happened will help.  And then calmly talk about it, say it wasn't expected, wasn't planned, but it happened.  Lets move forward.  And accept whatever comes your way.  If he wants to end it, okay, you'll find someone better who'll stick around after sex.  If he wants to work it, take it a little slower until he's comfortable again.  But it'll work out.  You just need a little time to get over all of this.  Good luck!"
850,9,"It would really depend on what you and your wife are into. May I suggest this?....Have a nice candle light dinner at home, it shows more thought. Make her favorite meal or something that's to both of your liking. If you are drinkers maybe try a little wine. Put on some nice music. After dinner maybe follow up with a nice sensual massage, women love that. Try using KY Touch Massage 2 in 1 WARMING body massage and personal lubricant. It's AMAZING. Caress her lovingly and let her know how much you care for her. Sometimes a touch is all it takes. After that, well....use your imagination. I can guarantee you that she will enjoy herself."
851,9,"Some do...But they won't notice you as easily.  I bet there are lots of girls who like you, but are, like you too shy to make the first move.  So you have to dig deep inside yourself and muster some confidence...Otherwise wait til college.  There are TONS of girls in college looking for a shy quiet guy because they are all played out on the loud, full of themselves, guys from High School."

Good luck"
861,9,"you really should put more details in. \n\nbut just from the top of my head, you can tell if a girl likes you if she's sending you the right signals. does she laugh at your jokes, even the corny ones? does she find excuses to touch you, like brushing lint off your sleeve? does she enjoy spending alone time with you? if yes, then she probably does. if not, then she might just see you as a friend.\n\ndon't be presumptious though. to get a straight answer, either talk to her, and find out if she has feelings for you; or you could do something drastic like kiss her on the lips, and see how she reacts. play it cool though. don't freak her out in case she DOESN'T like you."

864,9,"I could understand your urge to meet him, but it may not be a good idea. Guessing you met online, it's quite risky going thousands of miles away to some place alone. Now, if you were visiting with your own folks to IL, ask him to visit and meet your family. Never alone! Just to scare you a li'l more: there are plenty of people (older) who'd assume the fake identity of a 15 year old boy, to allure some 16 year old girl from somewhere else to have her visit him. Kidnapping, rape even murders may occur following that. Well, you get the picture. I know this is awful, but this happens, and many a times unfortunately."

870,9,"Well, try EVERYTHING. We think differently, approach problems differently, have different priorities, deal with our emotions differently. Biology is a major factor in our differences - not just what we look like, but the levels of estrogen and testosterone and the way they affect our behavior. Some of our differences are caused by the influence of society.\n\nThe important thing is to realize that it's GOOD that we're different. We complement each other. Problems occur when we don't make the effort to understand and accept the other group. Just because ""they"" don't act like ""we"" do, doesn't make either side wrong."

874,9,"I thinkt that it's at least normal that it hurts - if a little or a lot differs from person to person and from situation to situation.\n\nBut for me, the most important thing is, that it has to be the right person you're with and that you are as relaxed as you can be.\n\nI was very afraid, too - but my partner was so nice and grateful for what I was giving him, that even *if* I was in a lot of pain - and it hurt a lot - I was *proud* that I could give it to him and even enjoyed it because I *wanted* to be with him.\n\nSo it hurt - for me, it hurt a lot even though he was very gentle - but the pain didn't really matter to me because what mattered was that we had this special moment of closeness - and that was, what mattered, not the pain, that I knew would go away soon. \n\nAnd what is physical pain when you love someone for the first time!\n\nDon't be too afraid. Just don't hurry things. Wait for the right boy /man and than, take a lot of time. \n\nSex can be wonderful even if you are in pain (!) \n\nWhen it is the right person and when you know that he loves you and that he knows what you are giving to him in this moments."

877,9,"You mean she's spreading a rumor about you? I would first contact the dean of students, let them know that this girl is doing this, and she even admitted it to you. This is a bully tactic and would land her in mediation. That's what they did in my school when they were cracking down on school violence.  Mediation is a session where you, a counselor and the bully engage in 'peace talks' to get to the root of the problem. Most people who went to mediation came out best of friends. If your school doesn't do this, maybe you can emplore your school's dean for such a program because this is really distracting you from your education."

881,9,"Become her friend first.  Talk to her.  Get to know her.  Then call her and ask her if she wants to get dinner sometime (make sure you have a specific idea first).  You're not asking her to marry you, and chances are she'll say yes."

You are invading his personal space, if it were me, I would slam the door on your backside, on the way OUT! You are so childish and immature to believe that this man should not have any memory of his previous rendevous' or trysts, before your time!

883,9,"yes,a lot of them have the some problems .but after is more easier."
884,9,"First and foremost, be yourself. You wanna first talk about what is in the surrounding enviroment, clothing etc.  Be a customer, ask questions, not too many, and don't go to far into personal detail about yourself.  You don't wanna tell a girl everything right off the bat, cause then there wouldn't be that getting to know you stage.  Keep her curious, and make her laugh. Be confident, smile and get her curious.  Compliment her but don't go overboard.  Don't use words like hot, sexy, your fine.  Use words lik beautiful, nice, proper words not slangs.  Keep eye contact.  Don't look at her breast or behind, no matter how tempting it may be, don't do it.  Don't bug her, don't harras her, just go with the flow.  If its not there, learn from it and move on.  If it is there, than you'll see it in her smile and her eyes, if you pay attention to those two things than you can learn alot from a womans heart.

908,10,"Illegal immigrants, themselves, brought this issue to the forefront when they marched and protested and demanded rights and waved their flags in our streets last May.  THEY BROUGHT THEMSELVES to the attention of the citizens of the USA!  Suddenly, people started noticing the closure of hospitals due to being inundated with illegal immigrants who do NOT pay for their medical treatment.  Suddenly, people started looking around and seeing the devastation of their towns and neighbourhoods with illegal immigrants over-housing residences and overburdening schools and causing the education of their own children to be degraded and their neighborhoods to become unsafe and squalid due to over-housing - 10 or more people in a residence meant for a family of 4?  This causes safety hazards for purposes of fire and overburdens the sewer systems, garbage removal, parking on the streets, and lowers the property values of the homes in the neighborhoods, etc.  Suddenly, people realized that the reason they weren't able to find work in occupations they used to be able to earn a decent living in, such as construction and manufacturing, etc. was because of illegal immigrants who were willing to work for far less and usually ""under the table"" for cash, which illegal immigrants are willing to do because then they don't pay taxes on their income.  An American cannot work for that cheap, because they DO have to pay income taxes!  \n\nThis is a hot issue right now because of the huge number of illegal immigrants in the country now and the fact that they are pouring in at greater and greater numbers daily.  Previously, mostly only border states and towns were more aware of the illegal immigrants, but now they are starting to move further north and more and more states and towns are finding themselves negatively affected to a level that they can no longer turn a blind eye to it.  Illegal immigration is DEVASTATING our great country and the time has come to put a stop to it, however we have to do it.  The citizens of the USA have had ENOUGH and are no longer able to support the poorest of the poor from all the other countries of the world because we are needing to look after our own poor, first."

So to me, sounds logical that a child that does not graduate will not get funding (bank loans).  On the military issue, they have already dropped the strict requirements on entry due to the many now out of commission, either through death or through disability.  They will take whatever they can get, including many immigrants who've not received American citizenship.

Not hated enough to make a monetary difference in the income increase they will probably receive. Ever heard the saying ""Sticks and stones will break my bones but words can never hurt me!""\n\nActually I'm not sure where you heard that immigrants are hated. I find that strange, as a New Yorker.\n\nPerhaps if I lived in Texas I would feel the effects of immigrants from Mexico, but I doubt it. Even so, just cause Americans seem intolerant with their loud words and ""hatred"", they are pretty well behaved when it comes to violence.\n\nI bet a Chinese,Mexican or African Immigrant would have less of a chance of being injured in the United States by far, than in their home country. If they are white immigrants, they definitly will not have problems, except for maybe a couple of jokes at a bar.\n\nAmericans may be obnoxious and opiniated regarding immigration, but I think most people, like 99.9% of ""haters"" will not act on it. the others who do, would probably hurt anyone, regardless of race.\n\nAlso getting a Visa is a big deal, from what I hear.

923,10,"The regional progressive primary is definitely a better idea than ONE national primary.  The purely national approach would make it impossible for anyone to compete but those who could spend the big bucks immediately in the major population centers (big states like California, New York), and would very much cut against the historic concern --still seen in the much misunderstood and unfarily maligned Electoral College-- of allowing various states and regions to have a say in the selection of the President, not just big population centers.\n\nAnother note -- the criticism of our 'founding fathers' for the part and primary system is rather offbase.  The Constitution had NOTHING about parties, and most of our leaders initially railed AGAINST the formation of specific parties... but it still happened in the 1790s, and proved a more constuctive way to resolve issues than the focus on personalities that happened when there was not a functioning two-pary system (which could get quite personal and bitter, as both John Adams and his son found out).  \n\nAs for the whole primary system, that is later still, after the convention system was in place. (The first 'party convention' --with delegates from the various states-- was held by the newly organized ""Democratic"" party that made Andrew Jackson their, ultimately successful, candidate for President in 1828.)"
924,10,"From my recollection, people who fail the vision part of the driving exam get told to see an eye doctor.  It is up to the doctor to determine whether the problem is vision-related or cognitive, and whether it ought to keep the person from driving.\n\nIn the case of people who are legally blind or otherwise can't drive, the government does issue non-driver identification cards that can be used like a driver's licence for ID, but not for driving.\n\nIf the eye doctor feels a person failed the vision part of the driving exam because of a temporary problem (an eye infection that affected vision temporarily, for instance), they can write out a pass that basically says ""This person passed the exam at my office"" for them to bring back to the DMV.  Most of the time, though, it's left up to the doctor to explain to the 70-year-old why their eyesight is too bad for them to drive anymore."

My brother has done two tours in the second conflict that is occuring now.  The fact that the initial invasion of Iraq was termed ""Shock and Awe"" in no way reflects the theory of war you just presented.  One of the reasons both wars were so damned expensive was due to our determination NOT to hit civilian targets.  Overall, it would be much easier to carpet bomb a country into capitulation than to send in an invasion force.  Just as WWII Germans.  Dresden was firebombed to the ground.  We have not done even a slight portion of the damage done in previous wars.  When we target power installations in the first war, it was specifically to deny the Iraqi millitary electricity.  We don't bomb hospitals, sewage treatment centers, public water works, schools or other civilian infrastructure.  War is hell.  At least when we Americans commit to a war we don't rape, murder or pillage like U.N. troops."

939,10,"KGB is the Russian-language acronym for State Security Committee, Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti).\n\nFrom March 13, 1954 to November 6, 1991 KGB was the umbrella organisation name for:\n\n    * the principal Soviet security agency;\n\n    * the principal intelligence agency;\n\n    * the principal secret police agency.\n\nRoughly, the KGB's operational domain encompassed functions and powers like those exercised by the United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), the counterintelligence (internal security) division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Federal Protective Service, and the Secret Service.\n\nIn March 1953, Lavrenty Beria consolidated the MVD and the MGB into one body--the MVD; within a year, Beria was executed and MVD was split. The re-formed MVD retained its police and law enforcement powers, while the second, new agency, KGB, assumed internal and external security functions, and was subordinate to the Council of Ministers. On July 5, 1978 the KGB was re-christened as the ""KGB of the Soviet Union"", with its chairman holding a ministerial council seat.\n\nThe KGB was dissolved when its chief, Colonel-General Vladimir Kryuchkov, used the KGB's resources in aid of the August 1991 coup attempt to overthrow Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. On August 23, 1991 Colonel-General Kryuchkov was arrested, and General Vadim Bakatin was appointed KGB Chairman--and mandated to dissolve the KGB of the Soviet Union. On November 6, 1991, the KGB officially ceased existing, though its successor national state security organisation, the Russian Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti (FSB), is functionally much like the Soviet KGB.\n\nBelarus is the only post-Soviet Union era country where the successor state security organization continues to be known as KGB. Belarus is also the birthplace of Felix Dzerzhinsky, one of the founders of the KGB.\nFelix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky\nFelix Edmundovich Dzerzhinsky\n\nTasks and organization\n\nIts tasked responsibilities were external espionage, counter-espionage, the liquidation of anti-Soviet and counter-revolutionary organisations within the Soviet Union, guarding the national borders, guarding the Communist Party and State leaders, and critical state property. Also, it investigated and prosecuted thieves of State and socialist property and white collar criminals. Unlike Western intelligence agencies, the KGB (theoretically) was uninterested in learning the enemy's intentions--only their capabilities; intentions were political decisions based upon Marxist theory.\n\nIn espionage, the KGB mostly relied on human intelligence (HUMINT), unlike their Western counterparts, who relied more on technology--imagery intelligence (IMINT) and signals intelligence (SIGINT). Using ideological attraction, the Soviets successfully recruited many high-level spies. Most notable are the KGB successes in gathering US atomic secrets, and, in the UK, the Cambridge Five, especially Kim Philby of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS). Ideological recruitment abroad was nearly impossible after the Soviet Union crushed the 1956 Hungarian uprising. Instead, KGB was forced to rely upon blackmail and bribery to control most of its defectors. Still, this achieved notable successes, such as CIA mole Aldrich Ames and FBI mole Robert Hanssen, but fewer than in earlier decades.\n\nParalleling developments at MI5 and the CIA, the KGB had, before the dissolution of the Soviet Union, commercialized its advanced technologies for business applications. Artificial intelligence software which was formerly used to sort and filter signals intelligence has become available through companies such as Autonomy (an MI5 spin-off) and InfoTame (ex-KGB technologists).\n\nNotable KGB operations\nNKVD Headquarters on Lubyanka Square were designed by Aleksey Schusev.\nEnlarge\nNKVD Headquarters on Lubyanka Square were designed by Aleksey Schusev.\n\nDuring the 1945-1991 Cold War, the KGB of the Sov"

Strangely enough many believe the fantasy that Iraq is a whooping success story.  Forget about the forty odd people who die a day, forget about the fact that the US supported Iraqi government doesnt control an inch of dust outside of its precious greenzone. Some will still harp on about the relationship between Saddam and Al-Qaeda even though its been clearly proven that no such relationship existed. Some will castigate you for believing what they call liberal media propoganda, the voice of the hippies for spelling out the truth before them. If they only knew that they themselves are the subjects of a more vicious  propoganda effort by there leaders whom they blindly follow. Others will castigate you in the name of freedom trying to convince you and their own conscience that this is all about dear freedom.    In anycase it doesnt matter who's money it is because no serious rebuilding was planned or intended in the first place.

He would probably reserect that tired argument that lower class minorities are forced by their situation to join the military.  As someone from that background (Lower Class) I can say unequivocally that this is false.  There are opportunities out there for anyone who wants them.  I attended college before joining the military for example.  There are dozens if not hundreds of programs out there for those who wish to succeed.  The military is just one option.\n\nAs to his statement, ""You know that by joining you will be sent to Iraq right?""\n\nThat is possible but increasingly less likely.  I've been in for a while now and have tried on numerous occassions to volunteer to go down range.  Foolish perhaps but something many of us in the military want to do.

989,10,Wouldn't vote for him in the first place. Little thing called common sense.
990,10,"I doubt strongly that they'll change it anytime soon, however it's an antiquated law. Just like an age requirement. Theres no reason for it, if a person is a citizen they should enjoy equal rights."
991,10,"People saying he can only serve eight years are not exactly correct. If a vice president succeeds to the presidency more than halfway through his predecessor's term, he can seek election twice. In other words he can serve two whole terms in his own right, as well as the two years minus one day (or whatever) of his predecessor's term. Had Lyndon Johnson sought and won another term in 1968, he could have served as president for over nine years (November 1963 to January 1973).\n\nSo it is possible to serve more than eight years, but not ten or more.\n\nEDIT: Whoever gave me thumbs down is ignorant. Here is what the 22nd Amendment says: ""no person who has held the office of President...for *more than two years of a term* to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once."" Ergo, if he serves less than half of another's term, he can be elected twice."
992,10,L.A. was a much better drive May 1st.
993,10,"I concur. Hillary is the only democratic challenger that has any chance of defeating the GOP. I mean if not her, who? Howard Dean? Ha! Al Bore? You had your chance buddy! Liberman? Hell no! \n\nGOP is obviously afraid of her since she has always won by a landslide whenever she ran for office. Even if she were a ""carpetbagger"" in NY, she still won handidly.\n\nGOP is scared to death, trust me on that. That's why they keep claiming she isn't qualified.... yet to hear a valid reason why. Well, they don't know why, yet, because Karl Rove hasn't told them what to say."
994,10,Hell no! Genocide is never the way to resolve problems.
995,10,"I'll have you know those secrets were NOT borrowed!!!\n\nThey were SOLD during the Clinton administration.\n\nBorrowed, my word....sheeesh!"
996,10,"Since you are above 18, it doesn't really matter for most issues.  But this is a personal choice.  You should contact your local family court in your county for the proper procedures to file paperwork to make this change."
997,10,"I can not understand why so many keep rejecting my recommendation of Pee-Wee Herman for President. But if Pee-Wee isn't good enough, then maybe, ........... just MAYBE, Keanu could be."
998,10,That would be just impeachy!
999,10,"That's a good question: This from the Orlando Sentinal-\n\nOn Sunday, the Australian government issued the following alert to its citizens: ""We advise you to exercise a high degree of caution in the United Arab Emirates because of the high threat of terrorist attack. We continue to receive reports that terrorists are planning attacks against Western interests in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Commercial and public areas frequented by foreigners are possible terrorist targets.""   \nLINK\nhttp://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/opinion/orl-thomas21_106feb21,0,2383510.story\n\nI am thinking yes.  \nThe money used to fund the 9/11 attacks, most of it,  \nwas sent to the hijackers through the UAE banking system. The UAE stonewalled U.S. efforts to track  \nal Qaeda bank accounts after 9/11. In addition, the Emirates does not recognize Israel. And the UAE was a  \ntransfer point for shipments of nuclear technology to Iran, North Korea and Libya. And if those aren't good  \nenough reasons, I would just suggest I'm at a complete loss to offer what might be considered good reasons.""  \n      -- Lou Dobbs,  CNN"
