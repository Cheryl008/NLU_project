0,2,"SUMITOMO BANK AIMS AT QUICK RECOVERY FROM MERGER
  Sumitomo Bank Ltd &lt;SUMI.T> is certain to
  lose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result of
  its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.
      Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9
  trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank
  with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in
  October.
      But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu
  told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its
  position.
      ""We'll be back in position in first place within three
  years,"" Komatsu said in an interview.
      He said that while the merger will initially reduce
  Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand
  Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where
  it has been relatively weak.
      But financial analysts are divided on whether and how
  quickly the gamble will pay off.
      Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in
  view of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the merger
  was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch
  network from scratch.
      The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has
  expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business
  and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the
  wisdom of some of those moves.
      ""They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now
  it's largely out of their hands,"" said Kleinwort Benson Ltd
  financial analyst Simon Smithson.
      Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to
  enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American
  investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.
      Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5
  pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at
  least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange
  personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.
      ""The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the
  Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected,"" said one analyst.
      But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.
      ""U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so,
  we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three
  years, not until the 21st century,"" Komatsu said.
      Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes
  into the securities business at home.
      Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's
  version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial
  from investment banking.
      But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu
  said he hopes further deregulation will create new
  opportunities.
      ""We need to find new business chances,"" Komatsu said. ""In some
  cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust
  bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want.""
      Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such
  domestic securities business as profitable government bond
  dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co
  Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.
      He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering
  the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank
  subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.
       The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to
  securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon,
  following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European
  universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.
      But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar
  decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.
      ""We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed
  in two or three years,"" he said.
      Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand
  lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to
  replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.
      The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of
  time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the
  merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.
      ""It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies,"" said
  Kleinwort's Smithson.
      ""After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling
  around. It will be the next decade before we see if the
  strategy is right or wrong.""

1,2,"BOND CORP STILL CONSIDERING ATLAS MINING BAIL-OUT
  Bond Corp Holdings Ltd &lt;BONA.S> and Atlas
  Consolidated Mining and Development Corp &lt;ATLC.MN> are still
  holding talks on a bail-out package for the troubled mining
  firm, an Atlas statement said.
      Atlas, the Philippines' biggest copper producer, said it
  had been hit by depressed world copper prices. It reported a
  net loss of 976.38 mln pesos in the year ending December 1986,
  compared with a net loss of 1.53 billion in 1985.
      The company said it had been able to cut its losses because
  its scaled-down copper operations in the central island of Cebu
  started in the second half of 1986.
      Atlas said negotiations were continuing on the acquisition
  by Bond of the company's existing bank loans and their
  restructuring into a gold loan.
      A memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides in
  October last year said Bond would acquire Atlas' total loans of
  275 mln dlrs, to be repaid by the mining company in gold.
      Atlas said the two sides were also discussing equity
  infusion into Atlas and the creation of a development fund for
  further exploration and development of the company's gold
  properties in the central province of Masbate.
      Wilson Banks, general manager of &lt;Bond Corp International
  Ltd> in Hong Kong, told Reuters the Atlas statement on the
  negotiations was ""reasonably accurate.""
      Banks said Bond Corp was seriously considering several
  investments in the Philippines but did not give details.
      In its statement, Atlas said development of the pre-World
  War Two underground mines in Masbate had been accelerated and
  the ore tonnage had increased, extending the operation's life
  at least until 1993.

6,1,"CITIBANK NORWAY UNIT LOSES SIX MLN CROWNS IN 1986
  Citibank A/S &lt;CCI.N>, the Norwegian
  subsidiary of the U.S.-based bank, said it made a net loss of
  just over six mln crowns in 1986 -- although foreign bankers
  said they expect it to show 1987 profits after two lean years.
      Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad told
  Reuters, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries
  operating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring for
  investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic
  slump in Norway following last year's plunge in oil prices.
      Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in
  Norway since 1985.
      Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway's
  second-hand securities and equities markets, to be approved
  later this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements would
  make profit this year.
      Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, but
  Sejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned
  liberalisation and better economic performance, helped by a
  steadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel.
      Earlier this year, Chase Manhattan Bank's &lt;CMB.N>
  subsidiary decided to stop foreign exchange trading after heavy
  losses and focus instead on fee-based merchant banking.

      A statement said the firm expects to pay total dividends
  for 1987 of not less than 40 cents a share on the expanded
  capital.
      Jardine Matheson decided to withdraw its issue because of a
  joint announcement earlier today by Ronald Li, chairman of the

16,2,"SAN MIGUEL DEAL HIT BY MORE LAWSUITS
  A bid by San Miguel Corp (SMC) &lt;SANM.MN>
  to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United Coconut
  Planters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sources
  in the Philippine food and brewery company said.
      A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB
  from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC's
  outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on
  April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former
  chairman of both SMC and UCPB.
      Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF)
  and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.
      Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and
  represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB's
  plans to sell the shares to SMC were ""a serious breach of
  fiduciary duties.""
      The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be
  held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities
  and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a
  government nominee on the company's board.
      De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders,
  asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by
  the company's board.
      On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the
  sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per
  share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained
  earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the
  purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of
  dividends.
      De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate
  an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt
  to equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon
  del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would
  boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.
      In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier
  suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres
  Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.
      De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming
  last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong
  subsidiary &lt;Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares.
  The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board
  meeting.
      An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to
  resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by
  April 15.
      ""The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of
  a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard
  of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early
  disposition of the sequestered shares,"" San Miguel Corp said in
  a statement.
      ""Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have
  reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of
  payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the
  government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement
  of the controversy by April 15,"" the statement added.
      A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on
  Cojuangco's court petition, adding: ""Any statement coming from
  us might be interpreted as adversarial.""
      Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which
  sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible
  to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United
  States citizen.
      The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln ""A"" shares,
  which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln ""B"" shares which
  are available to foreign buyers.
      SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among
  prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by
  the &lt;A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed
  institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers
  in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.
      The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission on
  Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were
  owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President
  Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the
  U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend
  announced last June.
      ""We have no objection to Soriano buying the ""B"" shares,"" Diaz
  told Reuters. ""But everything is on hold now.""
      The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy
  would be resolved before the company's annual stockholders'
  meeting, scheduled for May 14.
      San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion
  pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in
  1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of

  Stauffer, plus some smaller assets of Chesebrough, since the
  bid was made in December.
      The Stauffer sale prospectus has been sent in recent weeks
  to a number of companies expressing interest.
      The Unilever spokesman declined to say how much the group
  expected to receive for Stauffer.
      Chesebrough's footwear and tennis racket businesses are
  also likely to be disposed of, he added.
      Immediately available financial information on Stauffer,
  which is wholly-owned, was limited, he added. Nine month sales
  to September 1986 were about 1.2 billion dlrs.
      Unilever aquired Chesebrough for 3.2 billion dlrs in order
  to benefit from its well-known toiletry brands and food
  products.

39,2,"PROXMIRE OUTLINES INSIDER TRADING LEGISLATION
  Senate Banking Committee Chairman
  William Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introduce
  legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of
  corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders.
      Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers,
  Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased
  the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.
      ""We are proposing legislation that would provide for more
  disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would
  insure that takeovers are properly financed,"" he said.
      Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold
  for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a
  investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a
  company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within
  10 days, Proxmire said.
      In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement
  that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have
  to filed with the SEC.
      Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to
  prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in
  knowing about coming takeover attempts.
      Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a
  tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60
  business days from the current 20 business days.
      His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring
  company violated the time period on the tender offer.
      To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire
  said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin
  requirments are properly enforced.
      The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement
  for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally
  enforced in hostile takeovers.
      Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover
  declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without
  actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.
      He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for
  failure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin
  requirements.
      The bill also would require more disclose when several
  investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.
      ""When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know
  about it,"" Proxmire said.
      Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain
  towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all
  shareholders recieve equal treatment.
      He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover
  defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.
      Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this
  month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring.
      He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this
  year.

  Bankers Trust New York Corp said it has
  placed its approximately 540 mln dlrs of medium- and long-term
  loans to Brazil on non-accrual status and that first-quarter
  net income will be reduced by about seven mln dlrs as a result.
      Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs
  of medium- and long-term debt on February 22.
      U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stop
  accruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue,
  but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of ""the high
  potential of a continued suspension that would result in
  reaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987.""
      Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are
  received for the rest of 1987, Bankers Trust estimated that
  full-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs.
      Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiations
  between Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to the
  resumption of interest payments.
      The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when central
  bank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a
  90-day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that
  matures on April 15.

  improved earnings this year,"" Burnell Roberts, chairman and

      Earlier, the company reported first quarter earnings of
  34.2 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share, versus 20.3 mln dlrs, or
  65 cts a share, in last year's first quarter.

      Mead said its first quarter benefitted from stronger market
  conditions and improved operations.
      ""The combination of capital improvement programs and more
  employee involvement has been paying off throughout our paper
  operations,"" Roberts said.
      He added that Mead's pulp and paperboard businesses are
  operating well as prices have improved and strong demand has
  placed most products in a sold-out position through the middle
  of the year.

      The bank said the initial distribution would take the form
  of a stock dividend of cumulative redeemable retractable class
  A series two preferred shares entitling holders to monthly
  floating rate dividends at 72 pct of prime and to 12.75 dlrs a

73,2,"ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY
  Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S.
  dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will
  propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record
  profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990,
  major company executives predicted.
      This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an
  industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF
  Corp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms
  to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.
      Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, the
  Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for
  money-making petrochemical businesses to buy.
      ""I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period,"" said
  Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding,
  ""There's no major plant capacity being added around the world
  now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving
  the old ones.""
      Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers,
  automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of
  paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.
      U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about
  90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike
  product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher,
  managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand
  for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up
  by as much as 300 pct, he said.
      Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in
  Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned
  last year and predicted it would have the best year in its
  history.
      In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel
  and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S.
  dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. ""I believe the entire
  chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it,""
  Oreffice said.
      GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical
  industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987.
  Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion
  dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.
      The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical
  industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and
  planning, said Pace's John Dosher.
      Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks
  dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar
  was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost
  U.S. chemical exports.
      Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has
  been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical
  manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers
  in the early 1980s.
      Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers
  have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program
  to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate
  unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of
  friendly and hostile takeover attempts.
      GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire
  Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs
  for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics
  and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA> 
  has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer
  businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.
      But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be
  headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on
  the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as
  ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that
  are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.
      ""Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the
  past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity
  chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had
  deteriorated,"" Dosher said. ""But I think they will eventually
  kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche
  market."" Some top chemical executives share the concern.
      ""The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting
  carried away and repeating past mistakes,"" GAF's Heyman
  cautioned. ""The shift from commodity chemicals may be
  ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long.""
      Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the
  Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700
  mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.
      Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout
  of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1
  billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants
  along the Texas Gulf Coast.
      The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that
  are the building blocks of specialty products.
      ""This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a
  glamorous, high-margin business,"" Cain said, adding that demand
  is expected to grow by about three pct annually.
      Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said
  chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for
  plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood
  and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical
  business could last as long as four or five years, provided the
  U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.

  &lt;Dominion Textile Inc> considers a

  Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the
  company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said.
      ""As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they
  are rumors and we're not commenting on rumors,"" spokesman Michel
  Dufour told Reuters in response to a query.
      ""All the information that has been given out publicly is
  that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an
  acquisition that big...probably based on that people are
  starting all sorts of rumors,"" he said.
      Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a
  rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment
  further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell
  was out of town and unavailable for comment.
      Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln-
  U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln-
  U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition.
      Dufour said the company has been negotiating with ""many""
  U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington
  Industries was one of them.
      Burlington's stock rose sharply this morning on the report,
  which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher
  Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a
  takeover offer.
      Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1
  mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has

88,1,"J.P. MORGAN &lt;JPM> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, TRADING
  J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its
  first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its
  previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status
  its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.
      That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interest
  payments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20
  mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the
  first three months of 1986.
      Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities
  underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln
  dlrs in the year-earlier period.
      In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading
  losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and
  underwriting of Euromarket securities.
      Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained
  difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering
  heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether
  Morgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.
      On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan
  losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign
  exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and
  trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.
      Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and
  commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net
  investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.
      Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first
  quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell
  to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.
      If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means
  that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are
  actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9
  mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume
  payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.
      After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for
  credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared
  with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.
      It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after
  charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49
  mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.
      Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were
  583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year
  earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from
  303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to
  personnel costs, Morgan said.

      In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the

      He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the
  telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect
  their state monopolies at the expense of other economic

  consolidated profit for its Agrimont Group, formed in June
  1986, totalled 1.5 billion lire in 1986.
      Agrimont SPA, the holding company for Montedison's
  Agro-Industrial businesses, had sales of 810 billion lire and a
  net profit of about 1.1 billion lire, after amortization costs
  of 35 billion lire and a 13 billion lire reduction in the value
  of inventory due to falling market prices, Montedison said.
      Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps
  to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said.
      The company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable
  fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of
  international prices for products sold in Europe and the U.S
  where Agrimont operates through its Conserv division.
      In pesticides and in animal health care products Agrimont
  maintained its previous level of revenues and market share in
  1986, Montedison said.
      Montedison said it named Ettore dell'Isola to the newly
  created position of president of Agrimont.
      Montedison also said it named Renato Picco, managing
  director of &lt;Eridania SPA> and Gianfranco Ceroni, managing
  director of &lt;Italiana Olii e Sifi>, both of whom are members

109,2,"TALKING POINT/BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES &lt;BUR>
  The largest U.S. textile maker focused
  on its own business as its competitors found merger partners,
  but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself
  into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said.
      The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose
  4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and
  Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct
  stake.
      A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly
  acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover
  offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for
  Montreal-based Dominion called the report just ""rumors.""
      Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.
      Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of
  the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if
  Burlington actually came into play.
      Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however,
  added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it
  was looking for a takeover in the U.S.
      Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills
  and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for
  a U.S. acquisition.
      A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer
  has been negotiating with ""many"" U.S. textile companies, but
  would not say whether Burlington was among them.
      ""There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not
  unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the
  housecleaning they've done,"" said Eileen Gormley of Thomson
  McKinnon.
      Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets
  and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs
  last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its
  operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign
  competition, Gormley said.
      ""They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer,""
  said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial
  fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets
  and other fabric to the auto industry.
      ""In the past, they just spent and never realized the return
  on the outlays they did make,"" she said.
      ""You look at their record over the year, and I think
  they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the
  past,"" Gormley said.
       She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up
  from 2.01 dlrs per share.
      Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington
  at its current levels.
      Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends
  selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50
  dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings
  basis.
      Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been
  placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.
      ""After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people
  don't find him very credible anymore,"" said one arbitrager.
      Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing
  managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if
  he doesn't win the target company.
      Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky
  Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying
  Ponderosa Inc.
      The stocks of other textile makers rose along with
  Burlington.
      J.P. Stevens &lt;STN> climbed 5/8 to 44-7/8, and Fieldcrest

124,1,"HEINEKEN SEES HIGHER PROFITS, WIDER PENETRATION
  Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped
  to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to
  the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite
  continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts
  to extend world penetration.
      Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln
  guilders, after 265 mln in 1985.
      Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe's
  leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986,
  said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.
      The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S.,
  Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe,
  where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.
      Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker
  foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.
      Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the
  increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El Aguila
  S.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly
  in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The
  company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in
  restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.
      Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit
  next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had
  already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.
      Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the
  European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer
  into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer
  market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. ""We
  have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important
  point,"" van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken
  had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.
      ""The question is not if we want to penetrate the German
  market, but how we are to do it,"" van Schaik said, adding that
  while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a
  taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very
  regionalized.
       Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for
  African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most
  important beer growth markets in the long term.
       He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with
  majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was
  hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.
      Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters
  per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions
  and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total
  1986 sales.
      On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price
  of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists
  have been looking at other possibilities.
      To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on
  the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which
  had sold successfully, Coebergh said.
      Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw
  materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were
  popular in Rwanda . ""This is a possibility, but we could not
  possibly achieve the Heineken flavor,"" Coebergh said.
      Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to
  penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a
  contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.
      But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's
  market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that
  are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western
  money.

132,1,"MEDTRONIC &lt;MDT> SEES 15 PCT EARNINGS GROWTH
  Medtronic Inc said it sees 15 pct
  growth in sales and earnings for the year ending April 30,
  1988.
      At an analysts meeting here the company said that for the
  year ending April 30, 1987 it will earn about 73 mln dlrs, or
  about 5.15-5.35 dlrs a share on sales of about 500 mln dlrs.
      In the year ago period, the company earned 53.4 mln dlrs,
  or 3.65 dlrs a share, on sales of 402.8 mln dlrs.
      Winston Wallin, Medtronic chairman, said the company will
  improve market share in fiscal 1988 in cardiac pacemakers and
  expand its cardiovascular therapeutic product line.
      Wallin cautioned analysts not to quickly change their per
  share estimates for the company as he said Medtronic will have
  heavy sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1988.
      He said the company intends to reinvest its earnings in its
  businesses and not in its dividends. ""Shareholders are better
  off if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividends
  or share repurchases,"" he said.
      Wallin said he sees Medtronic's share of the total
  worldwide pacemaker market increasing to 42 pct in fiscal 1988,
  from 40 pct in fiscal 1987.
      He said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeutic
  products, which includes pacemakers, valves, catheters and
  lasers, will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and will
  double that by 1995.
      Wallin said, ""Our objective is to get a hold of new
  products and start building market share if we have to beg,
  borrow or steal to get into new markets.""
      In the past, Medtronic's pacemakers have been plagued with
  a number of problems leading to product recalls. Regulators
  also have criticized the industry, citing quality problems and
  a needless overprescription of pacemakers.
      ""We have no knowledge of any major problems in our
  pacemakers or leads,"" Wallin said. ""We intend to re-establish
  our company as the quality leader in the industry.""
      Glen Nelson, executive vice president for Medtronics, said
  the company intends to diversify internally and through
  acquisitions of companies in areas of Medtronic's expertise,
  such as drug delivery systems.
      Wallin said the 15 pct earnings growth for fiscal 1988 does
  not include dilutions from acquisitions. ""We hope to have some
  safety provisions so that we won't have any major dilutions
  from an acquisition.""
      Wallin also said the company will have virtual exclusivity
  in rate responsive pacemakers for all of fiscal 1988.
      The company markets Activitrax, the first single chamber
  pacemaker that varies heartrate in response to physical
  activity.
      Siemens AG, a West German company, is also developing a
  rate responsive pacemaker.

  Showboat Inc will take a
  charge of 19 to 20 mln dlrs pretax against results for the
  third quarter ended March 31, director and assistant to the
  president J. Kell Houssels III told Reuters.
      He said the charge results from pre-operating expenses of
  its recently-opened Atlantic City, N.J., Showboat Hotel, Casino
  and Bowling Center and will cause a loss for the third quarter
  and probably for all of fiscal 1987 as well.
      But Houssels said Showboat's earnings for fiscal 1988
  should show a sharp increase from fiscal 1986 levels due to the
  contribution of the new Atlantic City facility.
      Showboat earned 1,753,000 dlrs in last year's third
  quarter.  For all of fiscal 1986 it earned 5,769,000 dlrs.
      Houssels said Showboat since the opening of the Atlantic
  City hotel/casino, Showboat has had to start charging interest
  expenses connected with debt it sold to finance the facility
  directly against income rather than capitalizing the interest
  as it had been able to do previously.
      Showboat opened the hotel during its third quarter and
  gaming began last Thursday on a regular basis after test gaming
  was completed earlier in the week.

137,1,"SECURITY PACIFIC &lt;SPC> LOANS PUT ON NON-ACCRUAL
  Security Pacific Corp said it is
  placing medium and long-term loans to Brazil and Ecuador on a
  non-accrual basis as of March 31, a move that will reduce first
  quarter earnings by 7.2 mln dlrs, or nine cts per share, after
  taxes.
      Despite the anticipated reduction to quarterly earnings,
  Security Pacific said it still expects to report first quarter
  earnings higher than the 88 mln dlrs, or 1.11 dlrs per share
  reported for the first quarter of 1986.
      The bank holding company said the action affects 401 mln
  dlrs of loans to Brazil and 73 mln of loans to Ecuador.
      Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs
  of medium- and long-term debt on February 20.
      Ecuador, which has foreign debt of roughly eight billion
  dlrs, has not paid any interest to foreign banks since
  February.
      In March Ecuador said it would suspend interest payments
  for the rest of the year because of an earthquake which halted
  the export of oil, which accounts for about 75 pct the
  country's export revenues.
      In its announcement, Security Pacific said it will record
  interest income only as it is received in cash.
      The company also said it believes that Brazil will reach an
  agreement with its banks and that interest payments will resume
  later in 1987.
      The Brazilian negotiations resume on Friday in New York
  when Central Bank Governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask
  banks for a 90-day roll-over of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term
  debt that matures on April 15.

  Union Texas Petroleum said its worldwide

  the end of 1986 from 555 mln barrels reported in 1985.
      In its newly released annual report, Union Texas said it
  replaced about 71 pct of its production of 56 mln barrels of
  oil equivalent last year after taking into account the sale of
  27 mln barrels of U.S. reserves.
      Union Texas, the nation's largest independent oil and gas
  producer based on revenues, is a privately-held company owned
  by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co and Allied-Signal Inc &lt;ALD>.
      The Houston-based company said it lost 57.5 mln dlrs on
  1.26 billion dlrs in sales last year, compared to profits of
  165 mln dlrs on 2.04 billion dlrs in sales in 1985.
      Union Texas said it received an average of 13.35 dlrs per
  barrel for its international oil production and 2.99 dlrs per
  mcf for its foreign natural gas sales. The majority of the
  company's total energy production is in the United Kingdom,
  Indonesia and Pakistan.
      In the United States, Union Texas said it completed
  evaluation work on its oil find in Alaska's Colville Delta
  area.
      ""Although significant oil reserves were confirmed,
  development of this discovery will not be economical without
  substantially higher prices,"" the company said.
      Union Texas said it planned to spend about 42 mln dlrs over
  the next two years to develop its Eugene Island Block 371 in
  the Gulf of Mexico.
      In 1987, the company said it budgeted 178 mln dlrs for
  capital spending, less than half of the amount spent in 1985
  and down from 199 mln dlrs budgeted last year. Union Texas also
  said it would seek acquisitions of oil and gas properties as
  well as petrochemical-related businesses.
  

"
140,2,"UAL &lt;UAL> MAY RESPOND TO PILOTS TODAY
  UAL Inc may have a response this
  afternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its United
  Airlines unit, a UAL spokesman said.
      ""Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and we
  need to get a clarification out,"" the spokesman said, adding
  that there was a ""50-50"" chance a statement would be released
  today.
      The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for
  2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt.
      Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for several
  weeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developer
  Donald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also
  held discussions with its chairman.
      The developer indicated in those talks that he took the
  position as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.
      Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying
  UAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2
  mln shares.
      ""United has got to consider this proposal. I think the
  pilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it,
  but it could put some interesting options in front of UAL
  management,"" said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.
      Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack
  when it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz
  rental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a
  strategy to become a travel service company.
      The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union
  concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention
  on its airline.
      UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its
  new focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.
      But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has
  been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100
  dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as
  widespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe
  the stock is in play.
      Market sources have said that although Trump attracted
  attention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a
  catalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps
  throwing the company into the hands of another buyer.
      ""The first domino is you have an investor with a
  considerable stake. the second domino is the union. That type
  of attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past,""
  said Pettee.
      ""What's interesting is the values are there. There's
  something for everybody,"" he said.

      Meinert reiterated an earlier comment that earnings for the
  remainder of the year must double the 1986 level to meet that
  goal. In fiscal 1986, ended November 30, 1986, Hartmarx
  reported earnings of 24.8 mln dlrs, or 1.20 dlrs a share, down
  from the prior year's 42.7 mln dlrs, or 2.25 dlrs a share.
      The 110-year-old apparel manufacturer recently posted
  first-quarter earnings of 54 cts a share, up from 40 cts a year
  ago.
      Meinert told shareholders Hartmarx has no plans to sell any
  of its divisions. He added, ""We have the financial capacity to
  take advantage of acquisitions.""
      In 1987, Meinert said the company will open five new and 10
  redesigned Kuppenheimer direct-to-consumer stores in Atlanta,
  Detroit, St. Louis, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco.
      He said the company's women's apparel continues to grow,

  proposed 1.5 billion dlr takeover of American Motors Corp.
      The letter of intent signed by Chrysler and Renault on
  March nine set April nine as the target date for completing
  negotiations.
      However, the letter also allowed room for an extension of
  that date to April 23 if an agreement could not be reached.
      The two companies said they ""now plan to complete work by
  April 23.""
      Chrysler and Renault said, ""Given the complex nature of the
  deal, the need for additional time was to be expected.""
      The March letter of intent between the two companies says
  that Chrysler could ask Renault to extend the agreement date
  ""in the event that prior to April 9, 1987, Chrysler discovers
  an unforeseen problem in the course of its 'due diligence'
  investigation of the company,"" referring to American Motors.
      A Chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problem
  had cropped up in the talks. She stuck by the company's
  statement that more time was needed because the talks are
  complex. ""That is our definition of the delay,"" she said.
      Under the previous agreement between Chrysler and Renault,
  their letter of intent would be terminated on April nine or
  when an agreement was reached. But the letter could be amendend
  by a written agreement by both companies.
      The Chrysler spokeswoman said, ""We are still working toward
  a definitive agreement."" Said another Chrysler official who is
  not part of the talks but who would be told if the deal were in

  performances in plastics, major appliances and the Employers

      GE recorded net earnings for the first quarter 1987 of 624

  1.18 dlrs per share for the same quarter a year ago.
      General Electric chairman John Welch Jr reiterated the
  company's outlook for 1987 in which it expects double-digit GE
  earnings growth for the year. He said the first quarter results
  are in line with those expectations.
      General Electric cited the strong results in TV network and
  station operations of the National Broadcasting Co, which was
  not part of GE in the first quarter of 1986, as one reason for
  its strong earnings.
      It also noted that aircraft engine operating profit was
  much higher than a year ago, caused by a increase in shipments
  than the 1986 quarter, which was impacted by a strike.
      Aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year's first
  quarter from a year ago, mainly because of the inclusion of
  RCA's aerospace and defense business, the company said.
      In addition, consumer products revenues were up from last
  year, mainly because of including sales of RCA video products.
      General Electric said restructuring provisions of 308 mln
  dlrs before taxes to implement various strategic moves were
  charged against operations in the first quarter of 1987. It
  added that there was a one-time gain of 281 mlns dlrs after
  taxes from an inventory accounting change.
      And technical products revenues and operating profit were
  ahead of last year, led by a strong increases in medical

  Williams Cos said it expected oil and

  operating profits from the pipeline unit should improve from
  49.4 mln dlrs earned last year when a seven mln dlr special
  charge was incurred.
      Williams Pipeline Co took the charge against earnings in
  1986 for the removal of more than 500 miles of old pipeline
  from service and for casualty losses. Companywide, Williams had
  a net loss of 134 mln dlrs on total revenues of 1.85 billion
  dlrs, a decline from profits of 32 mln dlrs on sales of 2.46
  billion in 1985.
      In its annual report, Williams said its Northwest Pipeline
  Corp and Williams Natural Gas Co had natural gas costs that are
  among the lowest in the nation, averaging 2.04 dlrs and 2.07
  dlrs per mcf, respectively, last year. Total natural gas
  reserves for both units declined to 10,010 billion cubic feet
  in 1986 from 11,334 billion cubic feet the previous year.
      The company said its Williams Natural Gas unit, which has
  less take-or-pay exposure than most major pipelines, should
  show improvement in its 1987 operating results because of
  changes tariff and federal tax rates.
      The company's gas marketing business is expected to have
  somewhat lower earnings in 1987 because of competition in its
  operating region, the annual report said. The gas marketing
  unit earned 26.0 mln dlrs on sales of 285.6 mln dlrs last year.
      Williams also said it expected a substantial decline in its
  debt to equity ratio this year because of more than 250 mln
  dlrs received in cash from the sale of Agrico Chemical Co and
  proceeds from the sale and leaseback of Williams
  Telecommunications Co. The telecommunications business, a

  American Brands Inc's 545 mln dlrs
  acquisition of National Distillers and Chemical Corp's liquor

       ""They were very frustrated with their inability to get

      American Brands failed late last year in its 2.9 billion

  buy the company. But since then, Wall Street has been
  speculating that American Brands would find another candidate

"
188,2,"ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TELECOM IS KEY JAPAN MINISTRY
  Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts and
  Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force
  to be reckoned with, political analysts said.
      MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S.
  And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of
  a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,
  they said.
      ""The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of
  a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,""
  said one diplomatic source.
      ""They are a potent political force,"" the diplomatic source
  said.
      But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not
  always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts
  said.
      ""The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not
  so internationalized,"" said Waseda University professor Mitsuru
  Uchida. ""Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world
  community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to
  face the situation.""
      Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with
  London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep
  a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in
  Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business.
      The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival
  groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one
  competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now
  monopolizes the business.
      It has also opposed a major management role in the planned
  merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on
  the grounds that no such international precedent exists.
      The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has
  threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger
  plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open
  its telecommunications market.
      Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it
  says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car
  telephone and satellite communications market.
      Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the
  sector it regulates.
      ""What has been happening is an important shift in the
  economy which makes the ministry a very important place,"" said
  James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory
  Service Inc.
      A decision to open the telecommunications industry to
  competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted
  rather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said.
      ""With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto
  legal framework,"" said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell
  Whitten.
      Close links with the powerful political faction of the
  ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime
  Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the
  analysts said.
      ""Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka
  faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance
  of MPT,"" Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of
  the influential political group, he added.
      The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to
  the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the
  Postal Savings System, analysts said.
      MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate
  interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial
  liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal
  Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than
  banks, they said.
      Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's
  obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized
  the ministry as feudal.
      Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting
  competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its
  wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest
  price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.
      But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of
  its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world
  including Britain, several analysts said.
      ""The United States is really the odd man out,"" Abegglen said.
  ""For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order
  in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable
  view,"" he said.

  Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp Plc &lt;RTZL.L>, RTZ,
  said the predicted rise in industrial production in the U.S.
  And Europe should boost its 1987 performance.
      Consumption of some base metals and their dlr prices are
  showing signs of improvement, although iron ore markets have
  weakened. The oil price in U.S. Dlrs is above the 1986 average,
  and if sustained, should improve energy earnings.
      The company was commenting in a statement on its 1986
  results which, on a restated basis, showed net attributable
  profits lower at 245 mln stg after 257 mln the previous year.
  Pretax profits also dipped to 601.7 mln stg after 614.4 mln.
      RTZ said the excellent performance of its expanding range
  of industrial businesses in 1986 was offset by the collapse in
  oil prices.
      Industrial businesses contributed 202 mln stg to net
  profit, a 40 pct increase from 144 mln in 1985, and 60 pct of
  the total. Trading performance improved at wholly-owned
  subsidiaries RTZ Borax Ltd, RTZ Cement Ltd, RTZ Chemicals Ltd
  and RTZ Pillar Ltd. First time contributions from recent
  investment and acquisitions mainly in speciality chemicals and
  minerals also aided performance.
      Metals activities contributed 83 mln stg to net profit.

199,1,"PHILIPPINE TELEPHONE FIRM PLANS STOCK SPLIT
  The Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co
  &lt;PLDT.MN> is planning a two-for-one stock split and a 20 pct
  stock dividend later this year to reduce excess market
  buoyancy, Vice-President Sennen Lazo told Reuters.
      Lazo said the stock split would reduce the par value of the
  company's common stock from 10 to five pesos.
      He said the stock split would apply to holders of about 18
  mln common shares of stock on the record date of September 15
  1987. ""The exercise should make our stock more marketable,"" Lazo
  said. ""Now it is beyond the reach of many small investors.""
      PLDT common stock surged from a low of 37 pesos in February
  1986 to 367.50 at close of trading yesterday on the Manila
  Stock Exchange.
      Lazo said the 20 pct stock dividend, payable on October 15,
  would also apply to stockholders on record as of September 15.
      PLDT reported 1986 net income of 1.89 billion pesos, up 68
  pct from 778.9 mln pesos in 1985, on operating revenues of six
  billion pesos, up from 4.7 billion pesos in 1985.
      At end December 1986 the company had 417,100 stockholders.
      A PLDT spokesman said the company's profits are likely to
  be substantial since the government raised its franchise tax to
  three pct from two and to impose a 35 pct corporate income tax
  from which it was previously exempt.
      The government has not so far ordered the implementation of
  the tax decision.
      PLDT is the largest of 58 telephone companies in the
  Philippines. On December 31 1986 the company had 856,014
  telephones in operation, representing 94 pct of all instruments
  in the country.

  Credit Commercial de France &lt;CCFP.PA>
  reported a parent company net profit up 34.8 pct to 140.1 mln
  francs from 103.9 mln francs a few weeks before its
  denationalisation around the end of this month.
      Official sources said the bank, France's sixth largest in
  terms of its deposits and seventh in terms of its assets,
  
  planned a share split to increase the number of shares on offer
  ahead of the sale of 40 pct of its ordinary share capital to
  the public, of 10 pct to staff and 20 pct abroad.
      Previously one of France's biggest private banks, it was
  nationalised by the Socialists in 1982.
      The sources said it was too early to give details of the
  planned split or of the share price, but cited April 27 as a
  likely date for the flotation launch.
      So far 30 pct of the group's capital, currently at 10.33
  mln shares of 100 francs nominal, has been offered for sale to
  large private investors to constitute a solid core of eight to
  ten shareholders before the flotation.
      The private tender offer closes on April 16, while a 12 mln
  franc advertising campaign for the flotation begins on Sunday.
  ""The privatisation will be a way of attracting extra clients,""
  CCF deputy director-general Rene de la Serre told Reuters.
      Market sources put the total value of CCF's privatisation
  at between four and five billion francs.
      De la Serre said the bank was likely to attract at least
  the same number of investors as &lt;Sogenal>, another recently
  privatised bank in which 850,000 people bought shares.
      The government's sweeping privatisation programme has also
  included the sale of Saint-Gobain &lt;SGEP.PA>, and Cie Financiere

  activities. The enlarged retailing operations of the Lex
  Automotive group now have a turnover of 530 mln stg. Lex's
  existing automotive interests include Volvo Concessionaires,
  the sole importer of Volvo cars and parts into the U.K.
      Lex said the turnover for Sears Motor Group in the year to

      Revenues increased by 0.5 pct to 17.35 billion guilders

  raised to 2.50 guilders per share from 2.38 guilders in 1985,
  corrected on a capital increase.
      The company said guilder revenue and profit were pressured
  by falls in exchange rates, particularly in the US and
  Australian dollar and sterling.
      Without these currency fluctuations, net profit would have
  been 30.7 mln guilders higher and revenue 1.97 billion higher,
  NatNed said.
      The international share in turnover was 50 pct in 1986
  compared with 52 pct in 1985.
      The company's life insurance result fell to 365.7 mln

206,1,"AEGON EXPECTS MODERATE RISE IN 1987 PROFITS
  Dutch insurer AEGON NV &lt;AEGN.AS>
  reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln
  guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits
  for 1987.
      Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion
  guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its
  revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a
  change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would
  have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.
      Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly
  due to its life insurance business.
      Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose
  despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and
  higher personal risks.
      Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage
  insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.
      In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and
  life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change
  in accounting for U.S. Annuities.
      AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal
  investment influences that it should be accounted differently
  from the more traditional insurances.
      This change in accounting practice and another change to
  account for profits made on fixed interest investments,
  resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln
  guilders.
      AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits
  were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial
  costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The
  Hague.
      In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged
  in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial
  costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.
      Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in
  May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these
  costs and made only a small contribution to the group's
  profits.
      AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill
  for Monumental Corp.
      AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December
  1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.

223,1,"PHYSIO TECHNOLOGY &lt;PHYT> SEES LOSS, IN DEFAULT
  Physio Technology Inc said it
  expects to have a third quarter, ended March 31, loss of about
  200,000 dlrs and is in default on its bank loan because of the
  resignation of chairman and chief executive officer.
      The company said the loss followed four quarters of modest
  profits. In the year ago quarter it earned 11,000 dlrs, or one
  cent a share. For the first half of fiscal 1987, it reported a
  profit of 42,000 dlrs, or two cts a share, compared to a year
  earlier loss of 294,000 dlrs, or 17 cts a share.
      It said President Michael R. Hall will assume the duties of
  chief executive officer.
      Physio Technology said the resignation of Chairman James C.
  Lane can constitute non-compliance with its Series A
  convertible subordinated debentures due 1996 and a default
  under its agreement with the Merchants Bank of Kansas City.
      It explained a declaration of non-compliance under the
  debentures would create a a default under the loan agreements
  requiring immediate payment of 1.8 mln dlrs of debentures and
  about 450,000 dlrs outstanding under the bank credit line.
      The company said the debenture holders intend to waive the
  non-compliance, but reserve the right to withdraw the waiver at
  the end of any 30 day period.
      Physio Technology said it is changing its field sales force
  to independent representatives and dealers from employees to
  ""significantly reduce its fixed overhead.""
      Its statement did not indicate how many employees would be
  affected by the move.
      The company said Lane will become an independent dealter
  for the company in certain midwestern states. He will continue
  to serve as a director, it added.

  Reichhold Chemical Inc said its
  board adopted a warrant dividend plan in which one preferred
  stock purchase right will be distributed as a dividend on each

      The company said its warrant dividend plan is designed to
  protect its shareholders against unsolicted, coercive attempts
  to aquire control without making an adequate offer for all
  shares.
      Reichhold said the adoption is not a response to any
  specific takeover attempt.
      Reichhold said each right will entitle shareholders to buy
  one one-hundreth of a share of a newly created series of
  preferred stock at an initial exercise price of 120 dlrs, with
  dividend and voting rights approximately equal to those of one
  share of the company's common stock.
      The rights will be exercisable only if, without Reichhold's
  prior consent, a person or group a acquires 20 pct or more of
  the voting power or announces a tender offer which would result
  in 20 pct ownership, the company said.
      Reichhold said it is entitled to redeem the rights at five
  cts apiece before a 20 pct position has been acquired, or
  before an existing 20 pct shareholder buys an additional two
  pct or more of the voting power of the company, or in

243,1,"VW SAYS 480 MLN MARKS MAXIMUM FOR CURRENCY LOSSES
  Losses for Volkswagen AG
  &lt;VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will
  not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW
  spokesman said.
      The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it
  would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on
  1986 business, despite the provision.
      One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency
  dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from
  the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but
  the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an ""upper limit.""
      VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board
  meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in
  detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign
  currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing
  company.
      VW has said computer programs were erased and documents
  were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes
  transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign
  currency losses were not completed.
      VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was
  arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having
  evaded justice.
      Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985
  profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and
  parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend
  an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has
  also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares,
  which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held
  dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.
      VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5
  billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment
  on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985,
  since the new capital was in preference shares.
      The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in
  order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At
  the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly
  less than three billion marks.

274,1,"NATIONAL DISTILLERS &lt;DR> SEES SECOND QTR GAIN
  National Distillers and Chemical Corp
  expects to realize a second quarter after-tax gain of four dlrs
  per share from the 545 mln dlr sale of its spirits business to
  American Brands Inc &lt;AMB>.
      National Distillers' stock rose 1-1/8 to 65-1/2, after an
  opening delay on the New York Stock exchange for an imbalance
  of orders.
      ""I think the sales price was higher than most people
  expected,"" said John Henry of E.F. Hutton Group.
      A company spokeswoman said the four dlr per share gain will
  be included in second quarter net, which compares with 31 cts
  per share last year, including the spirits and wine business
      ""They netted over 700 mln dlrs for spirits and wine. That
  will ease their interest cost burden,"" said Henry.
      National Distillers sold its wine business last month to
  Grand Metropolitan PLC's Heublein Inc for 128 mln dlrs.
      Henry said he had anticipated National Distillers would net
  only 600 mln dlrs at the most from the sale of the two liquor
  businesses.
      Henry said the company recovered from the sales the cost of
  buying Enron Chemicals in the fourth quarter last year.
  National Distillers paid 570 mln dlrs cash for Enron and
  assumed 34 mln dlrs in debt. National Distillers said at the
  time it bought Enron it would sell the spirits and wine
  businesses, moving more into the chemical area.
      For 1986, two thirds of income were from chemicals and
  propane. National Distillers earned, excluding the liquor
  businesses, 2.21 dlrs per share for 1986. Income from
  discontinued operations, including the liquor businesses, was
  67 cts per share.

      UAL rose 1-5/8 to 73-5/8 on volume of more than two mln
  shares, after trading with little upward movement earlier in
  the session.
      Traders said rumors, which began yesterday, added to
  speculation that the company would be the target of a takeover.
      They said it was believed Coniston Partners and the
  Pritzker family of Chicago were buying the stock.
      Coniston declined comment and the Pritzkers had no comment.
      Traders said there was speculation a bidder might appear,
  and also that real estate developer Donald Trump, who holds a
  stake in UAL, might participate in a takeover bid. UAL pilots
  said they would be willing to pay 4.5 billion dlrs, which
  includes debt, for the company's United Airlines unit.

  Texaco Inc &lt;TX> said its decision to
  file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
  code will not affect the majority of its businesses.
      It said its subsidiaries, which account for 96 pct of its
  32.6 billion dlrs in revenues and 79 pct of its net property,
  plant and equipment, were free of the action.
      Only parent holding company, Texaco Inc, and operating
  subsidiaries, Texaco Capital Inc and Texaco Capital N.V, are
  affected, it said.
      But the company said it was likely to suspend its 75 cents
  per share quarterly common stock dividend and halt repayments
  on debts of some 6.8 billion dlrs.
      Texaco said it filed for Chaper 11 because suppliers were
  demanding cash payments and banks were withholding loans as a
  result of a legal dispute with Pennzoil Co &lt;PZL>.
      Texaco is fighting a Texas law requiring it to post a bond
  of more than 10 billion dlrs before it can appeal a 1985
  judgment that ruled it illegally interfered with Pennzoil's
  1984 acquisition of Getty Petroleum Corp &lt;GTY>. The bond almost
  matches the damages awarded against Texaco.
      Should Texaco fail to place the bond, Pennzoil could begin
  to attach its assets to secure the judgment.
      Last Monday, the Supreme Court overturned a decision to cut
  Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs, and sent the issue back to
  the Texas courts.
      Analysts said the bankruptcy filing effectively froze all
  Texaco's obligations while it continued to appeal the merits of
  the Pennzoil lawsuit.
      ""Attempts last week to win a compromise on both the bond
  issue and the larger dispute failed,"" James Kinnear, Texaco's
  president and chief executive officer, told reporters.
      Kinnear said Pennzoil's disclosure in court papers on
  Friday that it wanted to extend the bond issue hearing until
  the end of April, pushed Texaco further towards Chapter 11.
      Pennzoil had asked Texaco to post a 5.6 billion dlr cash
  bond and to reduce its dividend to not more than 50 pct of
  earnings. Pennzoil also wanted assurances that Texaco would not
  sell any assets, Kinnear said.
      Texaco offered to put up one billion dlrs in a letter of
  credit and agreed not to let the value of its assets fall under
  11.1 billion dlrs, he added.
      Joseph Jamail, a Houston attorney for Pennzoil, said the
  company had made its latest settlement offer to Texaco on
  Saturday and was taken by surprise when Texaco filed for
  bankruptcy.
      He declined to reveal the amount of the proposal, citing a
  confidentiality agreement between the two companies. ""Texaco
  told us they would get back to us but instead they chose to go
  to bankruptcy court,"" Jamail said.
      Attorneys for Pennzoil said they believed the company would
  prevail in court appeals, adding that Texaco's assets were
  ample ultimately to pay the Pennzoil judgment in full.

395,2,"OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS
  A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome
  Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>
  may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door
  for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.
      Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt
  of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim
  debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer
  substantial payments to creditors will expire.
      Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders
  that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.
      Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
  public noteholders in March after several months of delicate
  negotiations.
      TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debt
  restructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker
  Ltd said from Toronto.
      Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow
  creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
  to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to
  cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
      ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
  even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
  Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""
  said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in
  Calgary.
      TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome
  was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
  refinancing packages, Gobert said.
      The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome
  since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
  to agree to a restructuring, he added.
      ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
  any and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said.
      Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that
  TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
  the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other
  possible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention to
  us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
  reluctant to come forward,"" he said.
      Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal
  offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
  confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
      Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions
  with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other
  unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and
  financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
  TransCanada's.
      Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price
  for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.
      However, he said not enough financial details are known
  about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of
  TransCanada's proposed offer.

      Most of its companies performed well despite a slowdown in

  mln stg, it noted.
      Morgan said although profits in the electronics sector
  improved to 1.0 mln stg from 100,000 stg previously, results
  were nonetheless disappointing.
      Sales were lower than expected, due mainly to delayed
  defence orders and cancellations. However, it said it had taken
  the necessary remedial action, obtained new business and was
  now proceeding with the delivery of major delayed orders.

403,2,"BORG-WARNER AGREES TO BUYOUT BY MERRILL LYNCH FIRM
  Borg-Warner &lt;BOR> Corp, facing an
  unwanted offer from GAF Corp &lt;GAF>, agreed to a 4.23 billion
  dlr buyout offer from a company to be formed by &lt;Merrill Lynch
  Capital Partners Inc>.
      Borg-Warner and Merrill said yesterday they entered a
  definitive merger agreement, under which a subsidiary of the
  new company, &lt;AV Holdings Corp>, will begin a 48.50 dlr per
  share cash tender offer today for 77.6 mln shares or 89 pct of
  Borg-Warner common stock.
      The offer will be followed by a merger in which each
  remaining share will be converted into 19.75 dlrs cash and
  54.25 dlrs principal amount of AV Holdings junior subordinated
  discount debentures.
      As a result of the merger, Borg-Warner will become a wholly
  owned subsidiary of AV Holdings. A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said
  members of management do not plan to participate in the
  transaction, but they will retain their positions with the
  company.
      A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds
  19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's shares.
      GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share.
      Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans to
  sell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargo
  security guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
      Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for
  about a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposed
  a takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the
  stock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakup
  values for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and
  speculated an offer would have to be sweetened.
      In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed the
  Merrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their
  shares. The board received opinions on the offer from its
  advisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co.
      James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners,
  said, ""We are very pleased to have entered into this transaction
  with Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with the
  employees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining its
  strong presence in the Chicago community.""
      Merrill Lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer,
  which expires at midnight EDT May 8 (0400 GMT, May 9), subject
  to conditions, including the completion of necessary financing
  arrangements.
      The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or
  51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered.
      Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed to
  provide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln in
  subordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments.
      Merrill Lynch said that following discussions with
  commercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the
  financing required to complete the transaction.
      The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in
  the merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying
  cash interest after five years.
      The debentures will be redeemable at the company's option
  for the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at
  102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount.
      The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity
  of 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in
  the 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before
  maturity.
      Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50
  dlrs cumulative preferred stock, series A, for 100 dlrs per
  share. Holders who wish to participate in the offer must first
  convert their preferred stock into Borg-Warner common stock.
      The board of Borg-Warner has also taken steps to redeem its
  poison pill or share purchase rights for five cents per right,
  effective immediately.

408,2,"TAKEOVER BATTLE FOR DOME PETROLEUM BEGINS
  A takeover battle began today for
  debt-burdened Dome Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> as TransCanada
  PipeLines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO> announced a 4.3 billion dlr offer and
  Dome said it is continuing talks with other possible buyers.
      Companies mentioned in market speculation as potential
  buyers for Dome include Imperial Oil Ltd &lt;IMO.A> which is 70
  pct owned by Exxon Corp &lt;XON.N>, &lt;PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd>
  which is 87 pct owned by the conglomerate Canadian Pacific Ltd
  &lt;CP.N> and British Petroleum Co Plc &lt;BP.L>.
      Along with the TransCanada offer, Dome has had another
  proposal from ""a substantial company"" and discussions with a
  third company which could lead to an offer, Dome said in a
  statement.
      The statement confirmed Dome received TransCanada's bid,
  but did not identify the companies involved in talks.
      TransCanada, Canada's largest natural gas pipeline
  operator, said it is offering Dome a package of cash, common
  and preferred shares, and shares in a new subsidiary which
  would own and operate Dome's assets. TransCanada said the offer
  is to Dome management, not to shareholders.
      Dome has massive oil and gas landholdings in Canada,
  totalling 36.1 mln acres of which 7.4 mln have been developed.
  It also has tax credits worth about 2.5 billion dlrs.
      Dome's statement said the TransCanada announcement ""violated
  the terms and spirit of a confidentiality agreement entered
  into with prospective purchasers"" and was apparently timed to
  prevent Dome from considering other proposals.
      It said the TransCanada bid ""seems to require favourable and
  substantial taxation concessions from the federal and
  provincial governments."" But Dome added that its management and
  financial advisers will evaluate all proposals.
      TransCanada chief financial officer H. Neil Nichols said he
  was surprised at the vehemence of Dome's statement and denied
  that TransCanada was trying to usurp other bids. ""I find (Dome's
  statement) very bothersome. Once the board made the decision to
  authorise the proposal, it had a legal obligation to announce
  it,"" he said. Nichols said he did not know the identity of the
  other bidders, or the terms of other offers.
      Dome common shares closed at 1.13 dlrs on Friday on the
  Toronto Stock Exchange. The preferred class A stock closed at
  5.00 dlrs. Common stock traded as high as 25.00 dlrs in 1981.

      Crazy Eddie said if a party owning 20 pct or more of its

415,2,"OFFER FOR DOME MAY SHORT-CIRCUIT ITS DEBT TALKS
  A 3.22 billion dlr offer for Dome
  Petroleum Ltd &lt;DMP.MO> by TransCanada Pipelines Ltd &lt;TRP.TO>
  may short-circuit Dome's restructuring plan and open the door
  for more takeover bids, oil analysts said.
      Dome is trying to get approval for a plan to refinance debt
  of more than 4.5 billion dlrs by July 1, 1987, when an interim
  debt plan that allowed the Canadian oil and gas firm to defer
  substantial payments to creditors will expire.
      Analysts said TransCanada's bid signals Dome's debtholders
  that an alternative exists to Dome's debt plan.
      Dome announced its plan to 56 major creditors as well as
  public noteholders in March after several months of delicate
  negotiations.
      TransCanada's proposal ""amounts to a quasi debt
  restructuring,"" oil analyst Doug Gowland of Brown Baldwin Nisker
  Ltd said from Toronto.
      Calgary-based Dome's restructuring plan would allow
  creditors to convert debt to common shares under a formula yet
  to be negotiated. Payments on remaining debt would be linked to
  cash flow generated by assets pledged against the debt.
      ""The weakness of the whole debt-refinancing proposal is that
  even with approval of creditors, there is no assurance that
  Dome will in fact be able to repay all of its debt obligations,""
  said Wilf Gobert, an oil analyst for Peters and Co Ltd in
  Calgary.
      TransCanada's announcement came as a surprise since Dome
  was waiting for responses from creditors on its proposed
  refinancing packages, Gobert said.
      The TransCanada proposal could open the bidding for Dome
  since other potential buyers were probably waiting for lenders
  to agree to a restructuring, he added.
      ""I would think that the debtholders would want to entertain
  any and all offers (for Dome),"" Gobert said.
      Dome spokesman David Annesley said in New York that
  TransCanada's announcement could be seen as an attempt to fix
  the bidding price for Dome and an effort to preclude other
  possible buyers from making an offer. ""By drawing attention to
  us in our discussions, it means that others may be a little
  reluctant to come forward,"" he said.
      Dome does not consider TransCanada's proposal a formal
  offer because the pipeline utility's announcement breached a
  confidential agreement between the two companies, he said.
      Dome responded to the statement by suspending discussions
  with TransCanada in order to pursue talks with other
  unidentified parties. However, Dome said its management and
  financial advisers would evaluate all proposals, including
  TransCanada's.
      Gowland said TransCanada's offer is probably a fair price
  for the company's 36.1 mln acres of oil and gas land holdings.
      However, he said not enough financial details are known
  about Dome's debt restructuring to compare the value of
  TransCanada's proposed offer.
  

"
416,2,"SOSNOFF RAISES BID FOR CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW>
  Investor Martin T. Sosnoff said he has
  raised his offer for Caesars World Inc shares to 32 dlrs each
  from 28 dlrs and has reduced the number of shares he is seeking
  to 29.1 mln from all those not already owned.
      In a newspaper advertisement, Sosnoff said the bid by his
  MTS Acquisition Corp, withdrawal rights and the proration
  period will now expire June 19 unless extended. The offer had
  been scheduled to expire May 15. In late March, Sosnoff said he
  had received a ""negligible"" number of shares in response to the
  offer, which had been rejected by Caesars as inadequate.
      Sosnoff already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30 mln
  common shares now outstanding, or a 13.3 pct interest on a
  primary basis.
      Last week, Caesars' board approved a recapitalization plan
  as an alternative to the Sosnoff offer under which shareholders
  would receive a special dividend of 25 dlrs per share, subject
  to approval by shareholders at a special meeting to be held in
  June.
      The company planned to borrow 200 mln dlrs and sell 800 mln
  dlrs in debt to finance the payout.
      Sosnoff said in the newspaper advertisement that the
  amended offer is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to
  give him a majority interest on a fully diluted basis and on
  the arrangement of financing, as well as to approvals by New
  Jersey and Nevada gaming authorities.
      He said the tender would be the first step in acquiring all
  of Caesars' shares and if successful would be followed by a
  merger transaction.
      Sosnoff said later in a statement that the 29.1 mln shares
  he is now seeking, together with the 4,217,675 shares he owns,
  would give him a 92.4 pct interest on a fully diluted basis.
      He said he still has received only a ""negligible"" number of
  shares in response to his tender.
      In a letter to Caesars' chairman Henry Gluck included in
  the statement, Sosnoff said Gluck had again refused, on April
  8, to meet with him, even though he had said he was willing to
  increase the price of his offer.
      Sosnoff said the financing for the offer is almost fully in
  place.
      Sosnoff said PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ> has now delivered
  to him commitments to purchase up to 475 mln dlrs of increasing
  dividend cumulative exchangeable preferred stock of MTS Holding
  Corp, an indirect parent corporation of MTS Acquisition.
      He said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, which leads a
  syndicate that has provided commitments for a 500 mln dlr
  margin facility, believes it will be able to arrange for
  further commitments under the margin facility to advance up to
  an additional 25 mln dlrs that may be needed to permit the
  purchase of shares under the offer.
      Sosnoff said under the merger that would follow his tender,
  each of the 2,750,000 Caesars shares not covered by the offer,
  or 7.6 pct on a fully diluted basis, would be converted into
  Series A preferred stock valued at 32 dlrs per shareby an
  independent investment baking firm.
      He said ""To the extent that fewer than 29,100,000 sdhares
  are purchased in the offer, the stockholders would receive a
  combination of cash and Series A preferred stock having a value
  of 32 dlrs per share of Caesars.""
      Sosnoff said he believes terms of his offer are superior to
  Caesars' recapitalization.
      Sosnoff said he will be meeting this week with gaming
  officials in Nevada in an effort to expedite the investigatory
  process required for regulatory approval, a process that it
  already underway in New Jersey.
      He said his offer has been extended based on the likely
  duration of the regulatory process.
      He said he intends to further extend the offer if the
  approval process is not completed by the expiration date.

  stockholders who will offer about 1.6 mln shares of Reebok
  common, and the underwriters.

  give us additional flexibility in the disposal of the remaining

       Allied Stores is required to pay 200 mln dlrs in bank debt
  by June 30. There had been some doubts on Wall Street that the

  Foster Wheeler Corp &lt;FWC> said an
  audit of its Stearns Airport Equiment Co Inc unit, revealed
  ""substantial discrepancies"" in Stearns accounts that may
  require material adjustments to previously announce
  consolidated results of the company and its subsidiaries.
      Foster said certain Stearn officers and senior management
  made Stearn's operations appear more profitable than they were
  by improperly recording job costs. It said Stearn's president
  and controller had resigned. A Foster spokesman said he did not
  know the names of the president and controller, and could not
  immediately comment on the release.
      Foster said the amount involved in the ""discrepancy"" is
  about 13.7 mln dlrs before taxes or about 8.2 mln dlrs net
  after tax due to an ""improper recording of job costs over a
  period of several years and continuing through part of the
  first quarter of 1987.""
      Stearns is a unit of Foster's Conergic Corp subsidiary.
  The company said the impact on its results for 1987 was not
  ""likely to be significant"" but the amount to be charged to
  prior periods had not been determined.
      Foster reported after tax earnings of 28 mln dlrs, 26 mln
  dlrs and 35.4 mln dlrs for 1986, 1985, and 1984, respectively.
      Stearns, based in Crowley, Texas, makes airport baggage
  conveyor equipment and passenger loading bridges.
      Foster, a diversified international concern with 27
  subsidiaries operating worldwide, is based in Livingston, New
  Jersey. Its reported revenues for the period ended December 26,
  1986 of 1.3 billion dlrs.

474,1,"CHEMICAL &lt;CHL> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, EXPENSES
  Chemical New York Corp said its
  first-quarter profits fell by 16 pct, largely because it placed
  1.04 billion dlrs of loans to Brazil on non-accrual.
      Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mln
  dlrs, down from 102.6 mln a year earlier, but declaring the
  Brazilian loans non-performing cost Chemical 21 mln dlrs in
  lost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax.
      A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrs
  from 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise was
  mainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth in
  consumer, capital markets and investment banking activities.
      Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual,
  Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or
  4.3 pct below 1986 earnings.
      Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of
  medium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are not
  resumed by year's end, Chemical said its after-tax net for the
  whole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs.
      Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador on
  non-accrual because the Quito government also suspended
  interest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interest
  income by 1.5 mln dlrs.
      Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrs
  from 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from
  3.96 pct.
      This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, a
  reduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculation
  of the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) and
  a narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical's
  cost of funds.
      Foreign exchange trading profits rose to 37.9 mln dlrs from
  27.0 mln, but bond trading profits dropped to 21.9 mln dlrs
  from 26.2 mln.
      Fees from trust and other banking services rose to 146.5
  mln dlrs from 129.3 mln a year earlier, Chemical said.
      The provision for loan losses was 87.2 mln dlrs, compared
  with 83.8 mln. Net loan charge-offs were 86.5 mln, up from 60.7
  mln, leaving the allowance for loan losses at 672.6 mln dlrs at
  quarter's end, or 1.74 pct of loans outstanding, compared with
  594.3 mln, or 1.50 pct, a year earlier.
      Non-accruing loans at the end of March were 2.39 billion
  dlrs (1.35 billion excluding Brazil), compared with 1.35
  billion at the end of 1986 and 1.22 billion at the end of
  March, 1986.

494,1,"NATIONAL WESTMINSTER BANK USA 1ST-QTR NET RISES
  National Westminster Bank USA said
  higher loans and core deposit volumes as well as a substantial
  increase in net interest income contributed to a 16 pct rise in
  first-quarter earnings to 17.7 mln dlrs from 15.3 mln reported
  a year earlier.
      The earnings gain came despite a 1.5 mln dlr reduction of
  income as a result of placing Brazilian loans on non-accrual.
      Net interest income totalled 92.5 mln dlrs compared with
  91.7 mln dlrs in the same 1986 period as loans, mostly to
  middle market businesses, increased by 896 mln dlrs. But some
  of these gains were offset by low levels of interest rates.
      Provision for loan losses rose to 13.8 mln dlrs from 13.0
  mln a year earlier. At March 31, the allowance for loan losses
  was 114.2 mln dlrs versus 94.8 mln at end of March 1986.
      Non-accrual loans rose to 286 mln dlrs from 132 mln at the
  end of the first quarter of 1986, largely because 119 mln dlrs
  of loans to Brazil were put on non-accrual status.
      The bank said that if these loans remain on non-accrual for
  the remainder of the year net income for 1987 would be reduced
  by about 4.9 mln dlrs.

515,1,"TALKING POINT/IBM &lt;IBM>
  International Business Machines Corp
  has started the year aggressively, but industry analysts said
  the company still faces some tough rounds in its fight to stop
  a two-year earnings slump.
      ""I am more impressed with what's happening at IBM than I
  have been in a long time,"" said PaineWebber analyst Stephen
  Smith.
      ""But they're not out of the woods yet,"" he added.
      At 1.30 dlrs a share, IBM's first-quarter net income easily
  topped most estimates on Wall Street, which had ranged from an
  even dollar to 1.20 dlrs.
      Most analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by IBM's
  performance. But they indicated that IBM's chances for a full
  recovery hinged on several key factors whose impact will not be
  felt until later in the year.
      These include the success of IBM's new personal computer
  line, introduced two weeks ago, and its 9370 minicomputers,
  which will begin volume shipments in July.
      In addition, IBM has said the full benefits of its
  early-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves will
  emerge as the year progresses.
      Analysts noted that IBM chairman John F. Akers was
  relatively more upbeat in assessing the company's outlook than
  he has been for nearly a year.
      ""Although the worldwide economic situation remains
  unsettled, there are some encouraging signs in our business,""
  Akers said, pointing to, among other things, higher
  first-quarter shipments. ""We remain optimistic about the
  prospects for both the industry and IBM,"" he said.
      ""Akers was most encouraging,"" said PaineWebber's Smith.
      A weak dollar, a lower tax rate and strong mainframe
  computer sales all contributed to the better-than-expected
  first-quarter results, analysts said.
      ""Shipments of the 3090 mainframes were very strong in
  March,"" after a weak January and February, said Ulric Weil of
  Washington-based Weil and Associates.
      Sales of the top-of-the-line mainframes, commonly called
  the Sierras, ""bailed out the whole quarter,"" Weil said, adding,
  ""If this continues, it augers well for the rest of the year.""

517,1,"IRVING BANK &lt;V> 1ST-QTR NET HURT BY BRAZIL
  Irving Bank Corp said a six pct drop
  in first-quarter net income from a year earlier was largely the
  result of placing medium- and long-term loans to borrowers in
  Brazil and Ecuador on non-accrual status.
      Income in the first three months fell to 28.60 mln dlrs
  from 30.43 mln in the same 1986 period. Earnings per share
  dropped to 1.51 dlrs from 1.62.
      Irving put 215 mln dlrs of Brazilian and 33 mln dlrs of
  Ecuadorean loans on non-accrual, reducing first-quarter net
  income by a total of 4.4 mln dlrs after tax.
      Irving estimates full year net would be reduced by 15.3 mln
  dlrs after tax if no cash interest payments are received on
  these loans during the remainder of 1987.
      Also adversely affecting earnings were losses on the
  trading of securities and higher non-interest expenses,
  although these were partly offset by increased trust income,
  profits from foreign exchange trading and investment securities
  gains, the bank said.
      The allowance for loan losses was 224.8 mln dlrs, up from
  185.2 mln a year earlier. The provision for loan losses was
  21.8 mln versus 19.5 mln in the first quarter of 1986.

      Following consummation of the offer, a unit of MacAndrews

      MacAndrews and Revlon also said they have reached a
  settlement with the plaintiff in the pending litigation
  challenging acquisition of the shares by MacAnrews.
      The companies said the tender offer and withdrawal rights
  will expireon Tuesday April 28, unless extended.
      MacAndrews said it will promptly file revised tender offer
  material with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Drexel
  Burnham Lambert Inc is acting as dealer-manager for the offer,
  the companies said.
      Revlon currently has about 42 mln shares outstanding. The
  current offer price is about 782 mln dlrs, a company spokesman
  said, up from the previous offer of 720 mln dlrs.
      On April 1, MacAndrews and Forbes, owned by Ronald

      This loss is an increase from the 60 mln dlrs loss reported

  entering a joint venture with United Telecommunications &lt;UT> in
  July 1986. Under the joint venture, each company owns 50 pct of

  Sprint's losses to diminish later this year as customer traffic
  migrates to the new fiber-optic network for long distance
  telecommunications.

  Goodyear expects to report a profit of more than one dlr a

      Mercer said about seven companies are interested in buying
  Celeron and they may form a consortium to buy the unit.

  Calif., to Texas refineries. Mercer said Celeron's reserves
  would not be sold separately from the pipeline.
      Concerning speculation that two billion dlr price tag for

547,1,"GOODYEAR &lt;GT> TO SELL CELERON
  Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co said it
  expects to sell its Celeron Corp oil and gas subsidiary for
  about two billion dlrs in about two months.
      After the company's annual meeting, Rober Mercer,
  Goodyear's chairman and chief executive officer, also said 
  Goodyear expects to report a profit of more than one dlr a
  share from continuing operations in the first quarter. In the
  same year-ago period, Goodyear reported a loss of 64 cents a
  share from continuing operations.
      Mercer said about seven companies are interested in buying
  Celeron and they may form a consortium to buy the unit.
      Celeron consists of oil and gas reserves and an almost
  complete pipeline linking drilling operations in Santa Barbara,
  Calif., to Texas refineries. Mercer said Celeron's reserves
  would not be sold separately from the pipeline.
      Concerning speculation that two billion dlr price tag for
  Celeron was too high, Mercer said ""There is no fire sale going

  operation throughout the year.""
      Mercer said the expected 1st quarter operating profit was

"
559,2,"GAF &lt;GAF> SEEN RAISING BORG-WARNER &lt;BOR> BID
  GAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-Warner
  Corp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts to
  be preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company.
       Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for
  4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch
  Capital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for
  89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash and
  securities for the balance.
      Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.
      ""I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming in
  with another bid,"" said one analyst, who values the company at
  51 or 52 dlrs per share.
      GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct of
  Borg-Warner's stock.
      ""You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up
  the price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have
  to. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking
  at it - that it's worth more,"" Pershing and Co analyst Richard
  Henderson said.
      Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.
      GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill
  Lynch officials did not return phone calls.
      Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman
  sought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics
  business. The rigid plastics are used in such things as
  telephones, computer terminals, and appliances.
      ""Where the heck can you buy a world class chemical
  operation these days,"" said Henderson.
      ""He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and he
  does not like to get pushed around,"" said Henderson.
      GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover
  of the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAF
  did not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its
  investment in Carbide.
      Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its
  Borg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer
  and does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would
  give GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock.
      ""It's a win-win situation,"" said one analyst.
      One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be
  forthcoming shortly.
      ""I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this
  book,"" he said.
      Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,
  protective services, which includes Wells Fargo security
  guards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
      Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows
  GAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, it
  would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per
  share.
      ""I think there's a probability he goes up in price,"" said
  Rose.
      Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heyman
  would do. ""Sam's a low-risk, high-return player.""
      ""Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical
  enterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank,"" Rose
  said.
      Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add
  earnings momentum to GAF. ""I worked out that paying as much as
  50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, if
  they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities,"" said John
  Henry of E.F. Hutton.
      Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986
  operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion
  dlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net
  earnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.
      ""The Borg chemical business is great,"" said Rose, adding
  its only U.S. competitors are Monsanto Co &lt;MCT> and Dow
  Chemical Co &lt;DOW>.

      ""We've no plan to bid,"" Blair told reporters after a speech

      The stock has fallen 2-1/4 to 56-1/8 so far today, after
  the news about the suit was released this morning.
      ""It's potentially a big suit and investors feel that its
  not good to go against regulators,"" Kenneth Ch'u-K'ai Leung, a
  Smith Barney analyst said.
      ""What investors are actually saying by selling off some BFI
  shares is the cloud over this industry is the threat that the

  Brown, senior analyst for First Albany Corp.
      ""Investors are saying to themselves that waste management
  companies have that kind of exposure to regulatory suits,""
  Brown said. Brown said if the suit were settled for 10 mln dlrs
  it would have an impact on Browning Ferris earnings.
      Leung said, however, that Browning-Ferris has adequate cash
  reserves to cover the fine. ""It would have no impact on

595,1,"HONEYWELL &lt;HON> CITES COST CUTTING FOR GAIN
  Honeywell Inc said a gain of
  20.1 pct in its 1987 first quarter operating earnings was the
  result of cost cutting efforts which began last year.
      Honeywell reported 1987 first quarter operating earnings
  rose to 43.7 mln dlrs or 96 cts a share from 36.4 mln dlrs or
  79 cts in the same period a year ago.
      Better operating results in each of the company's three 
  sectors offset higher interest costs in the first quarter due
  to financing the December acquisition of Sperry Aerospace and
  the sharing of the Federal Systems subsidiary pre-tax profit
  with Honeywell Bull Inc, Honeywell said.
      ""Our first quarter results show clear benefits of our
  restructuring,"" chairman Edson Spencer said. ""All of our
  businesses are producing better results than last year, even
  though we do not see significant improvement in the external
  market environment,"" he said.
      Total orders in the first quarter were up substantially,
  with a sharp increase in aerospace and defense orders in
  addition to those of the new Sperry Aerospace group, it said.
      Domestic industrial automation and control orders were
  modestly higher than the same period in 1986, it said.
      Orders in Honeywell's home and building automation and
  control business were flat in the U.S. and up in international
  markets, it said.
      International orders increased, with the greatest strength
  in Europe, Honeywell said.
      The company said that by year-end 1987, it intends to
  complete the repurchase of 3.3 mln shares remaining of a five
  mln share buyback program which began in 1986.

  American Century Corp said it
  has restated its earnings for the fiscal year ended June 30,
  1986 to provide an additional five mln dlrs to its loan loss
  allowance, causing a restated year-end net loss of 14,937,000
  dlrs, instead of 9,937,000 dlrs.
      The company said the change came after talks with the
  Securities and Exchange Commission on the company's judgement
  in considering the five mln dlrs collectible.
      In the note to its 1986 financial statement, American
  Century said it considered the five mln dlrs collectible,
  making its loan loss provision less than required.
      The company said in spite of the SEC decision, it still
  feels its allowance for possible loan losses at June 30, 1986
  was adequate and that it has considered all relevant
  information to determine the collectibility of the five mln dlr
  receivable.

      Merrill is offering 48.50 dlrs per share cash for 89 pct of
  Borg-Warner, and a package of cash and securities for the
  balance.
      The transaction with Merrill Lynch will take Borg-Warner

  do so in financing the deal, said sources familiar with the

636,2,"DOME &lt;DMP> BENEFITS FROM TAKEOVER SPECULATION
  Shares of Dome Petroleum Ltd posted
  their biggest gain in months in the U.S. and Canada as stock
  markets foresaw a takeover tug-of-war beginning for the
  debt-heavy company.
      Dome rose 1/4 to 1-1/8 on the American Stock Exchange and
  gained 31 cents to 1.44 Canadian dlrs on the Toronto Stock
  Exchange, where it was the most active stock. It rose as high
  as 1.50 dlrs in Toronto during the day. In recent months, Dome
  has normally moved by only a few cents per day.
      TransCanada PipeLines yesterday announced a 4.3 billion dlr
  Canadian (3.22 billion U.S.) bid for all of Dome's assets, but
  Dome, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, said it is also still
  talking with two other companies, which it refuses to identify.
      Market analysts today said the other two firms are believed
  to be foreign oil companies, noting that TransCanada yesterday
  stressed that its bid is ""a Canadian solution to the financial
  difficulties of Dome Petroleum.""
      ""The talk is about Conoco, which is controlled by DuPont
  &lt;DD>, and Atlantic Richfield Co &lt;ARC>, which sold its Canadian
  interest in 1975 and could be getting back in,"" said Wilf Gobert
  of Peters and Co Ltd.
      David Bryson of Moss Lawson and Co also noted that British
  Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> is mentioned as a possible buyer, despite
  BP's 70 U.S. dlr per share bid two weeks ago for the 45 percent
  of Standard Oil Co &lt;SRD> it does not already own.
      Calgary-based independent analyst James Hamilton has said
  in recent reports that Amoco Corp &lt;AN> has also been in talks
  with Dome.
      Representatives of Atlantic Richfield, British Petroleum,
  Conoco and Amoco were not immediately available for comment.
      Gobert characterized the market action in Dome today as ""awfully
  optimistic,"" given TransCanada's offer to give current Dome
  shareholders stock in a new subsidiary, which it valued at 1.10
  dlrs Canadian per common share.
      Under the offer, current Dome common and preferred
  shareholders would own 20 pct of the new subsidiary, which
  would own and operate all Dome's former assets. TransCanada
  would own 80 pct.
      However, Bryson said the market may be looking at the
  potential for shares in a publicly-traded subsidiary. ""The
  TransCanada offer has quite a bit of upside potential for Dome,""
  he said.
      Gobert said he believes the TransCanada offer is ""at the
  upper end of what I thought somebody would pay for Dome.""
      The TransCanada proposal would pay Dome's creditors 3.87
  billion Canadian dlrs (2.90 billion U.S. dlrs), with another
  one billion Canadian dlrs (750 mln U.S. dlrs) available to
  secured creditors if the Dome subsidiary earns profits above a
  certain level. TransCanada would not detail the profit level.
      Dome currently is seeking to restructure about six billion
  Canadian dlrs (4.5 billion U.S. dlrs) in debt, which it took on
  several years ago when oil prices were high and the company
  wanted to expand.
      ""There has been speculation that Dome's assets are capable
  of supporting debt of three to four billion dlrs, so on that
  basis, the TransCanada offer would be at the upper end of that,""
  Gobert said.
      Dome's debt troubles have often obscured the fact that it
  is a major player in the Canadian oil and gas field. It holds
  reserves of about 176 mln barrels of crude oil and 3.9 billion
  cubic feet of natural gas.
      The company also owns or has an interest in 14.2 mln acres
  of oil and gas exploration land in the province of Alberta, the
  heart of Canada's oil industry.
     Dome owns or has an interest in a total of 36.1 mln acres of
  land across Canada.
     The company also has tax credits of about 2.5 billion dlrs
  Canadian (1.9 billion dlrs U.S.). It reported a 1986 loss of
  2.2 billion dlrs (1.65 billion dlrs U.S.), believed to be the
  largest ever by a Canadian company.

655,2,"MERRILL TO GET 30 MLN DLR FEE IN BORG &lt;BOR> DEAL
  Merrill Lynch and Co Inc &lt;MER>
  subsidiary seeking to take over of Borg-Warner Corp said it
  could realize a 30 mln dlr fee for its efforts, whether or not
  the deal, which it values at 4.7 billion dlrs, succeeds.
      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  Merrill Lynch Capital Partners Inc said it would receive a 30
  mln dlr fee from the surviving company for acting as dealer
  manager of the merger after the Borg-Warner deal is completed.
      But it said it could also receive a break-up fee of 30 mln
  dlrs if the deal fails for reasons, which include another party
  holding more than 40 pct of its stock or tendering for 50 pct.
      The 30 mln dlr fee is among the highest set down in any
  tender offer agreement, either in compensation for dealer
  manager services or for break-up of the deal.
      Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, backed by a group of
  investors it organized, has launched a 48.50 dlr a share tender
  offer for Borg-Warner for 90 pct of its stock.
      The company's board has approved the plan, which was
  intended to thwart an unsolicited offer from GAF Corp.
      Borg-Warner also agreed to redeem all outstanding Series A
  preferred shares and to pay off on all options at a 48.50 dlr a
  share exercise price before the merger is effective, it said.
      Merrill Lynch said its representatives discussed a possible
  leveraged buyout with Borg-Warner as early as last December.
      At that time, Merrill Lynch told the company it would
  consider a 43 dlr a share tender offer in cash and securities,
  if the Borg-Warner board approved, it said. On Feb 24, it said
  it was told the company had decided against a buyout.
      But talks were revived after GAF launched its 46 dlr a
  share proposal on March 31, Merrill Lynch said.
      Unlike its earlier proposal, Merrill Lynch said Borg-Warner
  management was asked not to take part in the new deal and it
  was conditioned upon payment of the fees.
      In addition to its fees, Merrill Lynch said it will also
  get up to 17 mln dlrs from Borg-Warner to cover its expenses in
  the tender offer.
      Merrill Lynch said it would continue operating Borg-Warner
  as a subsidiary with its current officers keeping their
  positions.
      But for flexibility purposes, Merrill Lynch said it is
  considering redistributing Borg-Warner's assets to a number of
  subsdiaries of an entity it created to carry out the merger.
      All in all Merrill Lynch estimated that there would be 130
  mln dlrs in fees and expenses connected with the deal.
      Another 250 mln dlrs will be needed to repay certain debt
  of Borg-Warner, Merrill Lynch said.
      To finance the deal, Merrill Lynch said it expects to
  borrow 3.5 billion dlrs from a group of banks and sell 100 mln
  dlrs of common stock of the new company, sell 100 mln dlrs of
  non-voting preferred stock of the new company to Merrill Lynch
  and Co, sell up to 650 mln dlrs of subordinated notes to
  Merrill Lynch and Co and sell to the public 204 mln dlrs of
  subordinated discount debentures.
      GAF has raised its offer to 48 dlrs a share cash.

"
689,2,"AMOCO &lt;AN> MAY BUY DOME &lt;DMP>, REPORT SAYS
  Amoco Corp is apparently the successful
  bidder for debt-laden Dome Petroleum Ltd, according to a
  published report.
      The Toronto Globe and Mail, quoting sources close to the
  negotiations, today said Dome broke off talks last night with
  TransCanada PipeLines Ltd, which last week announced a 4.3
  billion Canadian dlr offer for all of Dome's assets.
      No financial details about the Amoco offer were available
  and a Dome spokesman would neither confirm nor deny that Amoco
  had emerged the winner, the newspaper said.
      However, the Dome spokesman indicated that the sale of Dome
  could be finalized and announced this weekend, the Globe and
  Mail said.
      Representatives of Amoco were not immediately available for
  comment.
      Last Sunday, when TransCanada announced its offer, Dome
  said it was also in talks with two other companies, but refused
  to identify them.
      Since then, market speculation has centered on Amoco and
  Exxon Corp's &lt;XON> 70 pct-owned Imperial Oil Ltd subsidiary in
  Canada.
      British Petroleum PLC &lt;BP> and Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD>
  have also been mentioned as possible suitors for Dome.
      In the past two days, Dome management has been pressured by
  the federal government to select the offer from TransCanada,
  the only Canadian company in the bidding.
      Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's government appears to want
  to avoid a Dome sale to a foreign company since the government
  gave Dome hundreds of millions of dollars in tax breaks to
  encourage oil and gas exploration in the Arctic, analysts and
  officials have said.
      A purchase by TransCanada would be least likely to run
  afoul of Canadian antitrust laws, however, TransCanada is
  asking for tax concessions from a federal government that is
  trying to hold its deficit below 30 billion Canadian dlrs,
  analysts have said.
      A takeover by Amoco or Imperial would also give a foreign
  oil company a dominant position in Canada's oil industry.
      Imperial Oil is already Canada's largest energy company,
  with 1986 revenues of 7.1 billion Canadian dlrs. Chicago-based
  Amoco had 1986 revenues of 20.23 billion U.S. dlrs. Its Amoco
  Canada Petroleum subsidiary is 100 pct owned by Amoco Corp.

  A congressional study today said the

  would technically be legal but could violate the spirt of the
  law setting up COMSAT.
      Two weeks ago before the study was completed, Contel
  announced it would seek to terminate the proposed merger.
      The study by the non partisan Congressional Research
  Service (CRS) said ""the proposed merger appears to comply,
  technically, with the mandates or letter of statutes, if may
  nevertheless violate the spirit of the law.""
      Comsat, created by a 1962 act of Congress, and Contel, a
  corporation of local telephone and communications firms, filed
  with the Federal Communications Commission last November 3 an
  application for merger. Several firms had protested the
  proposed merger.
      In an analysis of the law, the research service issued
  several critical comments about the structure of the new firm
  and said apparent domination by Contel of a restructured COMSAT
  would have broken the spirit of the law setting up

  alleging, among other things, that the offer vilates federal
  securities laws, certain agreements between Ciba-Geigy and
  Spectra-Physics, and Ciba-Geigy's fiduciary duties.
      Spectra-Physics said the two Ciba-Geigy designess to its

  voted to reject the offer as financially inadequate, unfair and
  not in the best interests of Spectra-Physics or its

763,2,"PAY N' PAK &lt;PNP> GETS TWO OFFERS FOR COMPANY
  Pay N' Pak Stores Inc said it received
  two proposals in response to its previously announced
  solicitation of potential buyers for the company.
      The company said it is evaluating the proposals from Paul
  Bilzerian and from a third party which is active in the
  leveraged buyout field but which Pay N' Pak declined to
  identify.
      It said the Bilzerian proposal calls for shareholders to
  receive on a blended basis 16.67 dlrs in cash and 3.30 dlrs in
  liquidation value of cumulative exchangeable redeemable
  preferred stock for each common share.
     
      Pay N' Pak said the second proposal is structured as a
  merger in which each holder would receive a combination of
  17.50 dlrs in cash and 2.50 dlrs in liquidation value of 13-1/2
  pct cumulative preferred.
      The company said the dividend on the preferred offered by
  Bilzerian would be set so that in the opinion his financial
  advisor and the company's financial advisor the preferred would
  trade in the public market at its liquidation value.
      Dividends on the preferred could be paid at the option of
  the surviving corporation in cash or additional shares of
  preferred for the first five years, it added..
     
      Pay N' Pak said Bilzerian's proposal is subject to a
  physical inventory of merchandise at June 30. Bilzerian did not
  provide details with respect to financing of his proposal,
  which is not subject to a financing condition.
      The company said dividends on the preferred being offered
  in the second proposal would be paid in additional preferred in
  the first three years and the preferred would be redeemed in
  years 12 and 13.
      It said the second offer is contingent on the arrangement
  of financing, adding the party making the offer is confident of
  its ability to obtain the balance of the financing.
     
      Pay N' Pak said the second proposal is conditioned upon a
  satisfactory agreement with the company's management regarding
  its equity participation in the new company.
      The second party anticipates executing a letter of intent
  when it delivers its financing commitment to the Pay N' Pak
  board that would incorporate an expense reinbursement and
  option arrangement, the company said.

764,2,"MAXWELL FILES SUIT TO STOP HARCOURT &lt;HBJ>
  Publisher Robert Maxwell's British
  Printing and Communicaton Corp PLC said it filed a lawsuit in
  U.S. district court against Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc, its
  directors and advisers to stop, among other things, payment of
  the special dividend Harcourt is paying as part of its
  recapitalization.
      The suit, filed in Manhattan, also names First Boston Corp
  &lt;FBC> and seeks to void the issue by Harcourt of 40,000 shares
  of super voting preferred stock to First Boston Securities Corp
  and the issue of convertible voting preferred stock with
  4,700,000 votes in the Harcourt employee stock ownership plan.
      The preferred shares to be issued to First Boston have
  8,160,000 votes. The suit, brought derivatively on behalf of
  Harcourt and individually in British Printing's capacity as a
  substantial holder of Harcourt common shares and 6-3/8 pct
  convertible debentures.
      The suit alleges Harcourt's special dividend exceeds by
  more than one billion dlrs Harcout's surplus available for
  dividends under New York law and contstitutes a fraudulent
  conveyance.
      The lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt failed to disclose
  that one consequence of the payment of the dividend, which it
  terms illegal, will be that shareholders will be liable to
  repay it.
      Harcourt last week said it would pay 40 dlrs per share to
  stockholders as a special dividend. Harcourt also announced an
  extensive recapitalization plan, which analysts said was aimed
  at thwarting a takeover effort by British Printing.
      British Printing last week withdrew its 44 dlr per share,
  or two billion dlr offer for Harcourt because of the
  recapitalizaton plan. At the time, it said it was reviewing its
  alternatives.
      British Printing said it filed the suit after consultation
  with its advisers. Its lawsuit also alleges that Harcourt
  failed to disclose the effect of the special dividend on
  Harcourt 6-3/8 pct convertible debentures.
      British Printing alleges the effect will be an enormous
  increase effective on the June eight record date for the
  dividend in the number of Harcourt common shares issuable upon
  conversion of the debentures. British Printing also charged 
  Harcourt is unlawfully coercing debenture holders to convert
  denbentures before the record date because Harcourt may not
  have enough authorized common shares to honor conversion after
  the date.
      British Printing holds 460,600 shares and 5.6 mln dlrs
  worth of debentures.
      The suit also alleges that management, the board of
  directors, and First Boston engaged in an illegal scheme of
  entrenchment through a combination of selling to First Boston
  Securities Corp the super voting preferred at a bargain price,
  the grant to the company employee stock plan of convertible
  voting preferred, the six mln share open market repurchase
  program and the manner in which its financing has been
  structured.

  a company's data processing facilities by increasing the speed,
  power and efficiency of large mainframe computers.
      The merger of Uccel and Computer Associates combines the
  two biggest systems utilities suppliers other than IBM.
  Analysts said the remaining players are mostly small firms that
  will find the competition much harder than in the past.
      For Computer Associates, the merger with Uccel caps a
  six-year acquisition campaign that has vaulted the Garden City,
  N.Y.-based company to the top of the software industry.
      When the deal is completed sometime in August, the
  company's revenues will exceed 450 mln dlrs, pushing it past 
  Microsoft Corp &lt;MFST> as the world's largest independent
  software vendor.
      Computer Associates founder and chairman Charles B. Wang
  took the company public in 1981, and since then he has bought
  15 companies and boosted annual sales from 18.5 mln to 309.3
  mln dlrs for the year ended March 31.
      Liemandt took charge of Wyly, sold off its non-computer
  businesses and decided that it would focus solely on mainframe
  computer software. In 1984, the company was renamed Uccel Corp.
      Liemandt, who said he will leave the company after the
  merger is completed, also turned to acquisitions for growth.
      On the last day of 1986, Uccel completed the buyouts of six
  companies for a total of about 60 mln dlrs.
      For 1986, it earned 17.0 mln dlrs, or 1.01 dlrs a share, on
  sales of 141.5 mln dlrs.
      The agreement took industry analysts by surprise, largely
  because the companies had been such bitter rivals. Also,
  Dallas-based Uccel had engineered a strong comeback from the
  dark days of 1982, when, as Wyly Corp, it lost 7.7 mln dlrs, or
  56 cts a share.
     At that time, Wyly owned a potpourri of 13 different
  businesses, only three of which were involved in computer
  software. In 1983, Walter Haefner, a Swiss financier and a
  major Wyly investor, lured Gregory J. Liemandt away from his
  job as chairman of General Electric Co's &lt;GE> computer services
  unit.
      Computer Associates' Wang and Uccel's Liemandt said at a
  news conference that the merger would give computer users a
  single source for a wide range of software products.
      In addition to system utilities, Computer Associates also
  sell products for microcomputers, while Uccel has made inroads
  in the applications software market, where analysts said it has
  been successful with accounting and banking systems.
      Wang said Computer Associates would continue to support and
  enhance both companies' product lines, but noted that the
  company will eventually weed out duplicate offerings. He said
  about 20 pct of the companies' products overlap.
      Analysts said the merger would dilute the holdings of
  current Computer Associates shareholders by about 10 pct. But
  they joined Wang in forecasting that the deal will not dilute
  Computer Associates' earnings for the current fiscal year.
      Quinn of E.F. Hutton said Wang has a proven track record of
  completing acquisitions without earnings dilution. Therefore,
  he said he would not change his 1988 earnings estimate of 1.05
  dlrs a share.
      Wang said he would look closely at the combined operations
  of the two companies and cut duplication in sales, marketing
  and research and development.
      Analysts said Computer Associates paid a premium for Uccel.
  Based on Friday's closing price, the company will swap 47.50
  dlrs worth of its stock for each Uccel share, which is nearly
  33 times Uccel's 1987 estimated earnings of 1.45 dlrs a share.
      Stephen T. McClellan of Merrill Lynch Research said most
  software companies are currently valued at about 20 times
  per-share earnings. But the analyst said Uccel was worth the
  premium because of its earnings potential and customer base.
  
      Wang said Haefner, the Swiss investor, would hold about 25
  pct of Computer Associates stock after the merger. He currently
  owns 58 pct of Uccel.
      The executive said the merger would not alter his target of
  maintaining sales and earnings growth of 30 pct to 35 pct.
      In addition, he said he expects no problems in having the
  deal cleared by the antitrust division of the U.S. Justice
  Department.
      Uccel's Liemandt declined to say what he will do after the
  merger, but he did not rule out working together with Wang.

  British press magnate Robert Maxwell said
  his British Printing and Communication Corp Plc would not renew
  its bid for Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc &lt;HBJ> if the lawsuit
  filed against Harcourt in New York today fails.
      Speaking at a press conference, Maxwell denied market
  rumors that British Printing had approached British
  institutions to arrange a rights issue with a view to
  relaunching its bid for the U.S. publishing concern.
      ""I don't believe in chasing mirages,"" maxwell said.
      British Printing filed suit in U.S. District Court in
  Manhattan to block what Maxwell called a fraudulent
  recapitalization announced by Harcourt last week.
      Harcourt, in response to a hostile two billion dlr takeover
  proposal from Maxwell, planned a recapitalization that would
  pay shareholders 40 dlrs per share. Under the plan, it also
  said 40 pct of its shares will be controlled by its employees,

  Investor Paul Bilzerian said if Pay N'
  Pak Stores Inc enters into a merger accord with him he will
  immediately begin a tender offer for 7.5 mln shares for 20 dlrs
  per share in cash.
      Bilzerian told Reuters he believes his offer is superior to
  a leveraged buyout proposal disclosed in an announcement by the
  company this morning.
      The company said it is evaluating both proposals.
  Bilizerian said he was optimistic his offer will be accepted at
  a meeting of the board of directors Wednesday. Officials of Pay
  N' Pak did were not immediately available for comment.
   
      Bilzerian said he has a pool of 150 mln dlrs raised by
  Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc available for the tender and ""we
  may add a bank to that.""
      ""We've submitted an agreement we're prepared to sign,"" he
  said. Shares not accepted in Bilzerian's tender would be
  exchangeable for 20 dlrs in convertible preferred stock.
      Asked what would happen if the leveraged buyout group,
  which the company did not identify, topped his offer between
  now and the board meeting, Bilzerian said he expected an
  opportunity to respond.
      Pay N' Pak gave no details about the buyout group, but did
  say the offer was contingent on financing and on an agrreement
  regarding management's equity participation.
      Bilzerian said it was his understanding that the management
  particpation was ""nominal.""
      Pay N' Pak fell 1-1/2 to 19. Arbitrageurs said there was
  disappointment that neither of the offers topped 20 dlrs.
      ""We were expecting an offer north of (above) 21 or 22
  dlrs,"" said one arbitrageur. The leveraged buyout plan was for
  17.50 dlrs per share in cash and 2.50 dlrs in 13-1/2 pct
  cumulative preferred stock.
  
      Robert Cheadle, analyst at Montgomery Securities, said ""you
  have to ask yourself why no one in the industry made a bid.""
      Scott Drysdale, analyst at Birr Wilson Securities, said the
  company has not made the best strategic moves over the years.
  ""They have not done the right things at the right time,"" he
  said, and as a result earnings per share have steadily declined
  since 1984. The 57 cts per share in earnings reported for the
  fiscal year ended in February was lower than 1978's earnings,
  he said. Earnings totaled 5.7 mln dlrs on revenue of 398.4 mln
  dlrs.
      Drysdale said Pay N' Pak has better trained sales people
  than many competitors, but it competes on price even though
  competitors have lower costs. The result is squeezed margins.
  He noted that there have been no other publicly identified
  bidders stepping forward since the company rejected an earlier
  Bilzerian proposal in mid-April.
      Another arbitrageur said it might not be too late for
  another bidder to get in the game. He speculated that someone
  in the same home improvement business might be able to offer a
  deal for stock that would top both the buyout proposal and
  Bilzerian's plan.

842,2,"USPCI &lt;UPC> SEEN REJECTING UNION PACIFIC BID
  share bid made last Wednesday by Union Pacific Corp (UNP), 
  analysts said.
      ""The offer is inadequate,"" said Douglas Augenthaler, an
  analyst with E.F. Hutton, noting that it does not represent the
  needed premium over the company's fundamental value based on
  earnings estimates.
      USPCI, which has 8.7 mln shares outstanding, was trading at
  48-1/8, down 3/8.
      USPCI vice president of finance Larry Shelton said he could
  not comment on the adequacy of the offer or on when the board
  would meet to consider it.
      Augenthaler said that while USPCI was trading at only 34
  dlrs a share at the time of the takeover bid, its announcement
  that same day of higher earnings expectations changed its
  value. USPCI said its second quarter earnings would exceed
  analysts expectations of 24 to 30 cts a share.
      At that price, USPCI could maintain a stock price in the
  low 40s, Augenthaler said.
      Hutton revised its 1987 earnings estimate for the waste
  management concern to 1.40 dlrs a share from 1.20 dlrs on the
  announcment, he said. It lifted its 1988 projection to 1.90
  dlrs a share from 1.70 dlrs.
      In addition, analysts said the hazardous waste management
  business holds significant growth potential. The industry has
  grown from 16 to 35 pct over the last five years, based on
  earnings per share, said Jeffrey Klein, an analyst with Kidder
  Peabody and Co. The industry is expected to continue growing at
  15 to 35 pct over the next five years, he said.
      Augenthaler said the 43-dlr-a-share offer, or 375 mln dlrs
  total, would be a bargain for Union Pacific. The transportation
  and energy company would both gain entry into a profitable
  business and win cost-control benefits, he said.
      ""Union Pacific has what are rumored to be some fairly
  signficant environmmental problems of its own,"" he said.
      Herb Mee Jr., president of Beard Oil Co (BEC), which holds
  a 30.4 pct stake in USPCI, said last week Union Pacific's offer
  was ""grossly inadequate.""

  New York investor Asher Edelman and

  said they lowered their stake in the company.
      In a filing with the Secruties and Exchange Commission, the
  Edelman/Dominion group, known as Samjens Acqusition Corp, said
  it sold options to buy 258,800 Burlington common shares,
  reducing its stake in the company to 3,408,813 shares, or 12.33
  pct, from 3,667,313 shares, or 13.3 pct.
      The group said the sale, which represented all the
  Burlington options it owned, was made May 28 for 8.7 mln dlrs.
      The Edelman/Dominion group last week sweetened its hostile
  tender offer to 77 dlrs a share, after Burlington agreed to a
  leveraged buyout by a Morgan Stanley and Co-backed group for 76
  dlrs a share.
      But the Edelman/Dominion group, which has litigation
  pending against Burlington, also said it has held talks with

849,2,"ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING TOPS CRAZY EDDIE OFFER
  A quickly growing Texas-based
  distributor of electronics products offered 240 mln dlrs
  for Crazy Eddie Inc &lt;crzy>, the leading New York City
  electronics retailer, or one dlr per share more than its
  founder has bid.
      The 8-dlr-a-share offer by Entertainment Marketing Inc &lt;em>
  for Crazy Eddie comes less than two weeks after founder Eddie
  Antar and a firm controlled by the Belzbergs of Canada
  announced a bid to take the 32-store Crazy Eddie chain private.
      Analysts said Entertainment Marketing, whose revenues and
  profits quadrupled in 1986, may be looking to break into the
  highly competitive New York City retail market for consumer
  electronics, the nation's biggest, at a time the fortunes of
  electronics retailers have sagged.
      The analysts questioned whether Houston-based Entertainment
  Marketing, founded by a former electronics retailer but whose
  present buinesses are primarily as wholesale distributors, had
  the management expertise for retailing or was merely trying to
  drive up the price of the Crazy Eddie shares it already owns.
      ""I have mixed feelings,"" said analyst Dennis Telzrow of
  Eppler, Geurin and Turner, a Dallas brokerage. ""On the one hand
  it's probably a cheap price. On the other hand, does
  Entertainment Marketing have the management talent to run it
  and will the Crazy Eddie people leave?""
      ""It's a risky strategy for Entertainment Marketing,"" said
  analyst Eliot Laurence of Wessels Arnold and Henderson, a
  Minneapolis brokerage. ""Electronics retailing is very management
  concentrated; they'd want to keep Crazy Eddie's management in
  place.""
      Laurence said that, since Entertainment Marketing already
  owns 4.3 percent of Crazy Eddie's 31.3 million shares, it may
  be trying to get the Antar-Belzberg group to increase its
  7-dlr-a-share offer.
      Shares of Crazy Eddie, which have jumped from the high
  4-dlr range to above 7 dlrs since the Antar-Belzberg bid was
  announced May 20, rose another 50 cents Monday to 8.375 a share
  in over-the- counter trading. 
      Antar, the reclusive founder of the chain in the New York
  City, Philadelphia and Connecticut areas, said last month that
  his group controlled 14 percent of Crazy Eddie's shares.
      A Crazy Eddie spokesman said the company's board has taken
  no decision on the Antar-Belzberg offer, worth some 187 mln dlrs
  since they own more shares than Entertainment Marketing. He
  would not comment on the new offer.
      Entertainment Marketing sells computer products such as
  disk drives and other, often discounted electronics goods to
  retailers, primarily in the southwest, and directly to
  consumers by cable television.
      In fiscal 1986, ending last January, its revenues rose to
  87.9 mln dlrs from 21.3 mln dlrs the previous year. Net profit
  went to 3.2 mln dlrs from 750,000 dlrs in 1985.
      Entertainment Marketing, whose chief executive officer,
  Elias Zinn, once ran an electronics retailing business, said in
  a statement it had committed 50 mln dlrs toward the purchase
  of Crazy Eddie and had retained Dean Witter Reynolds Inc to
  assist in financing the balance.
      Analyst Telzerow estimated that the company would have to
  borrow about 100 mln dlrs to complete the proposed buyout since
  Crazy Eddie has cash and other assets worth about the same
  amount.
      Shares of Entertainment Marketing were up 12.5 cents Monday
  to 9.50.

852,2,"INVESTORS MAY TAKE COMPUTERLAND PUBLIC
  The investor group that has agreed to
  buy &lt;Computerland Corp> will likely take the leading personal
  computer retailer public or sell it to other investors,
  industry analysts said.
      ""Now's a good time,"" said Joe Levy of International Data
  Corp. ""The personal computer industry has bottomed out and is
  on the way up again,"" he said.
      Earlier today, closely held Computerland, the largest PC
  retailing chain in the country, said it agreed to be bought by
  an investor group led by E.M. Warburg Pincus and Co, New York.
      Neither Computerland, which is 96 pct owned by its founder,
  William H. Millard, nor E.M. Warburg, a money management and
  venture capital firm, would disclose the value of the
  transaction.
      Analysts estimated that Computerland, whose 800 stores
  generated 1.4 billion dlrs in sales last year, would fetch  150
  mln dlrs to 250 mln dlrs. Computerland franchise owners pay
  royalties averaging 5.9 pct to the parent company.
      Officials for E.M. Warburg referred all questions to
  Computerland. Computerland officials could not immediately be
  reached for comment.
      E.M. Warburg currently manages 1.5 billion dlrs in venture
  capital funds, and its past investments have included Mattel
  Inc &lt;MAT> and the Ingersoll newspaper chain. It is also a money
  manager, with 3.5 billion dlrs under management.
     Although the PC retailers are benefitting from the strong
  upturn in PC sales, analysts said Computerland must make key
  changes if it is to fend off advances from rivals like
  Businessland Inc &lt;BUSL.O> and Tandy Corp's &lt;TAN> Radio Shack
  stores. ""The name of the game now is outbound sales forces,
  customer service and customer support,"" said Levy of
  International Data.
  
      Relations between Computerland and its franchise owners
  have mellowed recently after Millard was forced to give up
  managment control of the company in 1985.
      Ed Faber, who took over as chairman and chief executive
  officer, revamped the company's royalty plan, which help quell
  much of the franchisee dissent.

856,2,"BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> HEARING TO CONTINUE TOMORROW
  U.S. District Court Judge Eugene
  A. Gordon said he plans to issue a decision tomorrow on
  Burlington Industries Inc's request for an injunction to stop
  Samjens Acquisition Corp's takeover bid for the company.
      Wall Street sources have said the outcome of the case could
  be pivotal in determining the winner in the fierce takeover
  battle for Burlington, the largest u.s. textile maker.
      Gordon presided over six hours of argument today by lawyers
  for Burlington and Samjens, a partnership formed by Dominion
  Textile Inc and New York investor Asher Edelman.
      Hearings are scheduled to continue tomorrow. A preliminary
  injunction would hold up Samjens 2.47 billion dlr offer until
  the case is decided.
      Burlington had previously agreed to a 2.44 billion dlr
  buyout from Morgan Stanley Group Inc &lt;MS>, one dlr per share
  lower than a sweetened 77 dlr per share bid made by Samjens
  last week. Burlington has not responded to the new Samjens
  offer.
      Burlington has alleged in its lawsuit that Edelman and
  Dominion used illegally obtained confidential information about
  the company in making their takeover attempt.
   
      That information, Burlington said, was provided by James
  Ammeen, a former Burlington executive, through PaineWebber
  Group Inc &lt;PWJ>. Ammeen, who had worked for Burlington for 23
  years, had as many as 12 divisions with 50 pct of Burlington's
  sales reporting to him. When he left Burlington in November,
  1985, Burlington said he signed a contract promising never to
  divulge inside information about the company.
      Burlington lawyers said shortly after he left he began
  working with a PaineWebber employee on a hostile plan to
  ""takeover the company, dismember the company and displace its
  management,"" Burlington lawyer Hubert Humphrey said.
      Samjens lawyers acknowledged it received information from
  PaineWebber, but argued the information was public information
  and could be obtained either from texitle industry analysts or
  Burlington's public financial statements.
      Burlington lawyers said PaineWebber and Ammeen met with
  Edelman and Dominion in November and continued to meet with
  them until a couple of days before Edelman and Dominion went
  public April 24 with their intention to take over the company.
  Burlington lawyers claim Dominion's board decided to attempt a
  takeover of Burlington after Ammeen met with the board in
  February.
      Burlington lawyers said Edelman and Dominion held
  discussions with PaineWebber and Ammeen about acting as
  financial advisers to Samjens. But they allege talks broke off
  because Painewebber and Ammeen could not satisfy Edelman and
  dominion with a written statement that they did not provide
  inside information.
      Lawyers for Samjens contended that Painewebber and Ammeen
  withdrew as potential advisers because Burlington chairman
  Frank Greenberg had called a PaineWebber executive and
  threatened legal action if PaineWebber got involved in an
  effort to takeover Burlilgnton.
      ""The ultimate question is not the price per share or the
  profit, but rather the permissable standards of conduct for
  those who would takeover an American company,"" said burlington
  lawyer Humphrey.
      Burlington lawyers also contended that Burlington, as the
  largest manufacturer of denim in the United States, would be in
  violation of anti-trust laws if it acquired Dominion, Canada's
  largest textile maker. Dominion has denim manufacturing plants
  in Georgia, which would reduce competition in the denim market,
  the lawyers said.
      Samjens' lawyers discounted the concern. They said the
  market for denim is more fragmented than Burlington contends
  and that Burlington has the ability to switch between light
  weight and heavy weight denim production as demand and price
  dictate.
      Samjens lawyers also pointed to a lawsuit filed by
  Burlington in Canada, in which it said it was considering a bid
  for Dominion. ""Surely, what would have been sauce for the goose
  would have been sauce for the gander,"" said Sidney Rosdeitcher,
  a Samjens lawyer.

  plus a security worth 10 dlrs. Holders would also retain stock
  in the recapitalized firm.
      The debentures had been convertible at 34 dlrs per share.
  Harcourt's May 26 announcement said the conversion price would
  be adjusted according to the indenture covering the securities.
  Arbitrageurs said the conversion formula yielded a ""negative

862,2,"EQUITICORP TASMAN TO BID FOR MONIER LTD
  &lt;Equiticorp Tasman Ltd> (ETL) said it will
  offer 4.15 dlrs a share cash for all the issued capital of
  Monier Ltd &lt;MNRA.S>, currently the subject of a 3.80 dlrs a
  share bid by CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S>.
      Alternatively, ETL will offer three shares plus 82 cents
  cash for each Monier share, it said in a statement.
      As previously reported, ETL moved into the market for
  Monier shares last week, taking its stake to 13.7 pct by
  Friday.
      It now holds 14.99 pct, the maximum allowed without Foreign
  Investment Review Board (FIRB) approval. ETL is classified as
  foreign because of its New Zealand base.
      The ETL cash offer values Monier's issued capital of 156.28
  mln shares at 649 mln dlrs, against 593 mln for the CSR bid.
      Based on the current price of ETL shares of 1.05 dlrs, the
  alternative is worth 3.97 dlrs per share, but ETL said the
  value placed on its shares for the offer aproximates to the
  diluted asset backing of ETL as at March 31.
      ETL said the offer will have no minimum acceptance
  conditions and will be subject to Australian foreign investment
  and U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino anti-trust clearances.
      ETL chairman Allan Hawkins said in the statement that the
  shareholding in Monier was a long term investment.
      ETL and its &lt;Feltex International Ltd> associate have
  targetted the building products sector as an area of expansion
  and Monier fits well with this aim, he added.
      Monier chairman Bill Locke said in a separate statement
  that the independent directors of Monier intend to recommend
  acceptance of the ETL bid in the absence of a higher bid.
      He also said Monier will not now proceed with the
  one-for-two bonus issue announced with its interim results on
  March 19 in view of the proposed takeover bids.
      As previously reported, the CSR offer involves a complex
  put and call option deal with Monier's major shareholder,
  Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, which gives Redland the choice of
  accepting the CSR offer for its 49.8 pct stake or moving to
  50.1 pct within six months of the bid closing.
      CSR officials have made it clear that they see Redland
  taking the second option, resulting in the two companies
  running Monier as a joint venture.
      CSR officials have also said they had no intention of
  raising the company's bid for Monier after ETL's intervention
  became public last week.

863,2,"JAPAN OIL INDUSTRY DECONTROL MAY LEAD TO MERGERS
  Deregulation of Japan's oil industry could
  mean hardship for smaller firms and lead to their merging into
  bigger refining and marketing groups, industry sources said.
      They said the relaxation of controls was now under review
  by the Petroleum Council, an advisory panel to the Ministry of
  International Trade and Industry (MITI).
      A spokesman for a major firm said, ""Deregulation would bring
  about a reorganization. If it's a by-product of freer
  competition, we have no choice but to accept it.""
      The Council is due to close its discussions on June 12.
      The sources said the Council was likely to tell MITI it
  should end its 50 year-old protection of the industry. It
  should cut capacity to 3.8 mln barrels per day, about 75 pct of
  current capacity. Quotas should end for crude throughput and
  gasoline output, and oil tariffs should be abolished.
      They said deregulation was vital to promote more
  competition and efficiency, and most saw it as inevitable.
      ""Deregulation is taking place everywhere. Now it's our turn
  to see if we can survive cut-throat competition,"" said a source
  at one major Japanese oil company.

  time surviving, but that's something we must go through.""
      ""In addition to our streamlining and efficiency programs for
  the oil division, we will exert efforts towards branching out
  further into other lines such as real estate and travel
  agencies,"" he said.
      Larger companies are also streamlining. Nippon Oil Co Ltd
  which had the largest share of refined products sales in the
  Japanese market in fiscal 1985, cut nine pct of its refining
  capacity in fiscal 1986.
      Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, the third largest seller of oil products
  in 1985, cut its workforce by some 20 pct last year, a
  spokesman for the company said.
      Between 1984 and 1986, on the recommendation of the
  Council, 13 oil companies were integrated into 11 companies
  within seven refining and marketing groups to improve the
  efficiency of the industry.
      Oil industry sources said this structure was now likely to
  be streamlined further into five refining groups.
      ""MITI means business. It will urge the major seven groups to
  merge into five to build up their muscles,"" a source said.
      A MITI official told Reuters he did not rule out the
  possibility of further mergers within the Japanese oil industry
  in the event of the relaxation of oil controls.
      He declined to officially confirm or deny that the
  Petroleum Council had recommended deregulatory measures but
  said that in principal MITI would encourage a move towards
  deregulation.

      Stad Rotterdam chairman Lucas van Leeuwen told Reuters it
  may raise its stake to a majority interest if the two companies
  are found to be sufficiently compatible.
      Van Leeuwen said that due partly to the fact Europeesche
  made losses in 1985 and 1986, the 20 pct stake was obtained at
  below the shares' intrinsic value. He gave no precise sum.
      The Europeesche, which specialises in travel and recreation
  insurance, had a premium income of 150 mln guilders in 1986.
      Stad Rotterdam's premium income in 1986 was 1.17 billion
  guilders, making it the fifth largest Dutch insurer.
      Europeesche made a loss of nine mln guilders in 1985, which

  French industrial gas group &lt;Duffour et
  Igon> has decided to back the takeover bid by Swedish
  industrial gases group Aga AB &lt;AGA.ST>, ending a lengthy battle
  between rival bidders from France, Spain and West Germany,
  Duffour et Igon Chairman Jean Igon said.
      The board agreed late last night to back the Aga bid and
  advise its shareholders to accept the Swedish group's latest
  offer of 4,410 francs per share, he told Reuters.
      The other main bidders were Union Carbide Corp's &lt;UK.>
  French subsidiary &lt;Union Carbide France> and West Germany's
  Linde AG &lt;LING.F>.
      Aga topped rival bids for the gases distribution group in
  May by raising its offer to 4,410 francs from 4,000 francs.
      This was accepted by Spain's &lt;Carburos Metalicos SA> which
  sold Aga six pct of Duffour et Igon's stock and the right of
  first refusal on the remaining nine pct of stock it holds. It
  also won over the French Midi-Pyrenees development authority
  which agreed to sell Aga its 20 pct stake in Duffour et Igon.
      Under Aga's offer, shareholders can either accept a cash
  bid or exchange one share in Duffour et Igon for one bond of a
  nominal value of 4,410 francs with a 10 pct coupon issue by Aga
  France SA. The bond issue is guaranteed by the parent Aga AB.
      The takeover battle for the Toulouse-based company, which
  controls eight pct of the French industrial gas distribution
  market, began on April 2 with an offer of 2,100 francs per
  share from Union Carbide France &lt;UK>.
      Aga's offer, which puts a price of 587 mln francs on the
  company, closes on June 24 and the results will be announced on
  July 21.
      Duffour et Igon shares were quoted yesterday at 4,410
  francs, with no buyers, after a series of suspensions during
  the takeover tussle. They traded at 856 francs on January 9

  deal worth around 14 mln stg.
      The full names of the companies purchased from Gallaher are

  Weybridge.
      Consideration for the purchases, which will be based on the

      The sale by Gallaher reflects a decision to dispose of more

886,2,"CSR SAYS IT IS PROCEEDING WITH OFFER FOR MONIER
  CSR Ltd &lt;CSRA.S> intends to proceed with
  its planned bid for building materials group Monier Ltd
  &lt;MNRA.S> despite the counter-bid from &lt;Equiticorp Tasman Ltd>
  (ETL), CSR executive director Gene Herbert told Reuters.
      ETL said today it would offer 4.15 dlrs each for Monier's
  issued capital of 156.28 mln shares, plus a share alternative.
  This compares with a 3.80 dlr cash element in CSR's proposed
  bid.
      The proposed offer by ETL, controlled by New Zealand
  entrepreneur Allan Hawkins, came after it built up a 14.99 pct
  stake in Monier in a 95 mln dlr share raid in recent days.
  
      Herbert said Britain's Redland Plc &lt;RDLD.L>, which holds
  just under 50 pct of Monier, still supported the CSR bid and
  had told CSR it is not a seller.
      He said Redland wanted to maintain and build on its
  operations in Australia and the U.S., Where Monier has built up
  a strong presence, notably in roofing tile manufacture.
      The CSR offer contains a put and call option agreement with
  Redland. This enables Redland to accept the CSR bid within six
  months of its close or to lift its stake to 50.1 pct in the
  same period and to run Monier as a joint venture with CSR.
      CSR has said that Redland will take up the second option.
  
      ETL has declined to say why it intervened in Monier, beyond
  describing it as a long term investment.
      ETL would bring no synergies to Monier, unlike CSR which is
  a leader in building materials, Herbert said.
      ""We fit better with Monier,"" he said.
      CSR has said that it will concentrate development on its
  core businesses of sugar and building materials after its moves
  into energy several years ago.
      Asked what he thought ETL's bid sought to achieve, Herbert
  said: ""I'm puzzled as to what Hawkins' strategy is. One has to
  wonder if Monier is the main target.""
  
      Herbert said CSR had no plans to raise its bid, and said a
  higher price would be difficult to justify on fundamentals.
      Monier was trading at 2.80 dlrs when CSR launched its
  original bid of 3.50, or 16.8 times earnings, in late April.
      The shares closed at 3.90 dlrs today, down 25 cents on
  yesterday, after ETL withdrew on reaching the top foreign
  shareholding level permitted without Foreign Investment Review
  Board (FIRB) approval. Its bid is subject to FIRB approval.
      Herbert also said that institutions, which are more likely
  to accept a share alternative than cash, would have to judge
  the respective values of ETL and CSR shares.
  
      ETL is the third group to become involved in a possible
  acquisition of Monier this year. Redland held discussions on a
  possible takeover before the CSR bid emerged but the
  negotiations foundered on the price.
      Share analysts said that for this reason, they did not
  think ETL's intervention would flush out a full Redland bid
  although Monier's ultimate fate rests in its hands.
      ""Redland is still in the driving seat,"" said Tim Cohen of
  &lt;Ord Minnett Ltd>, adding that Redland would be happier having
  CSR as a partner in running Monier than ETL.
      Monier's independent directors have recommended ETL's bid.

901,2,"JUDGE TO DECIDE BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> IN SEVERAL DAYS
  U.S. District Court Judge Eugene
  A. Gordon said he will decide ""in the next few days"" whether to
  grant Burlington Industries Inc's request to stop a takeover by
  Samjens Acquisition Corp.
      ""I do not know how I come down on this preliminary
  injunction,"" Gordon said after listening to arguments by
  attorneys for 1-1/2 days.
      ""It's been a long time since I was deluged with as much
  information as I have been. I have to consider what's been
  presented and issue an opinion on this. Both sides cannot be
  winners,"" he said.
      Burlington requested the injunction to stop a takeover
  effort by Samjens, claiming the partnership used illegally
  obtained confidential information about the company to make its
  offer. It also alleges there would be anti-trust violations if
  Samjens, formed by Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of
  Canada, were to succeed.
      Samjens last week topped a 76 dlr per share offer for
  Burlington from Morgan Stanley Group &lt;MS> by one dlr per share.
  Morgan Stanley made its 2.44 billion dlr bid after Samjens bid
  72 dlrs per share for Burlington.
      Burlington lawyers told the court if the injunction is not
  granted Samjens would win control of Burlington. A Samjens
  lawyer argued that if the judge granted the injunction it would
  ""kill the offer""
      Jay Greenfield, an attorney for Samjens, said the
  partnership would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction
  were granted. ""There's only one Burlington,"" he said. ""If we
  cannot get that then no amount of money can compensate us.""
      Greenfield also said Samjens could sell its holdings in
  Burlington for 95 mln dlrs. ""We don't want that. We're not in
  this for the money,"" he said.
      Irving Nathan, a Burlington lawyer, reiterated that
  information provided by James Ammeen, a former Burlington
  executive, was crucial to Dominion's decision to attempt o
  takeover of Burlington.
      ""Dominion relied on the information provided by the insider
  Jim Ammeen,"" Nathan said.
      An attorney for Ammeen, who is named as a defendant, asked
  the court to dismiss the lawsuit against his client. The judge
  said he would not rule on the request today.

902,2,"ALLEGIS &lt;AEG> TO SELL CANADIAN HOTELS
  Allegis Corp said it has created a

  public.
      It said the offering is expected to raise in excess of 350
  mln Canadian dlrs and will be completed by the end of
  September.
      The limited partnership will be similar to the Westin
  Hotels limited partnership completed last year when Allegis
  sold Westin hotels in San Francisco and Chicago. Allegis
  reported a pretax gain of 80.6 mln dlrs as a result of that
  partnership.
     
      An Allegis spokesman said the offerings have been in
  planning stages for a long time and are unrelated to recent
  corporate developments such as the firm's recapitalization plan
  and a threatened takeover by an investor group lead by Coniston
  Partners and the pilots of its United Airlines unit.
      The spokesman said the company has not yet identified which
  of its Canadian hotels will be offered for sale.
      Allegis has 100 pct ownership in Westin hotels in
  Vancouver, Calgary, Ottawa and Toronto, and 100 pct interest in
  Hilton International hotels in Toronto and Montreal. It owns 60
  pct of the Westin in Edmonton.
      Richard Ferris, chairman of Allegis, said in a statement
  the hotel limited partnerships allow the company to convert
  unrecognized asset appreciation into cash.
      As with the proceeds from the earlier limited partnership,
  the money will be used for general corporate needs, the
  spokesman said.
      Merrill Lynch Capital Markets and Wood Gundy will be lead
  underwriters for to the public offering. The limited

  Spectra-Physics Inc said it is
  considering the possibility of recapitalizing, restructuring,
  or seeking a buyer for the company following its rejection of
  an unsolicitied 32 dlr a share bid from Ciba-Geigy Corp.
      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  the San Jose, Calif., gas lasers and accessories company also
  said its board Sunday agreed to a plan that gives 52 top
  executives bonuses ranging from 20 to 50 pct of their base
  salary if they stay with the company through August 29.
      In rejecting the takeover proposal by the U.S. subsidiary
  of Swiss-based Ciba-Geigy AG, the company said it was unfair.
      The Spectra-Physics board voted unanimously, with two
  Ciba-Geigy representatives not participating, to reject the
  Swiss-based chemical and pharmaceutical company's takeover bid,
  citing an opinion from its financial advsior, Morgan Stanley
  and Co Inc, that it is ""inadequate and unfair from a financial
  point of view to the holders of shares,"" the company said.
      The board also authorized a special committee and Morgan
  Stanley to ""vigorously investigate, pursue and authorize any
  alternatives which would maximize the value of shareholders'
  investment in the company,"" the company said.
      Among the alternatives the special committee will consider
  are a sale of the company to a third party for more than 32
  dlrs a share, a recapitalization or restructuring, including
  self tender offers and/or asset dispositions through the use of
  dividends, Spectra-Physics said.
      The ""retention plan"" for the 52 top officers will pay an
  average bonus percentage of 28 pct of salary, it said.
      Spectra-Physics said its board approved the plan ""in order
  to encourage key operating personnel to remain with the company
  during the period of turmoil and uncertainty engendered by the
  (Ciba-Geigy) offer.""
      Under the plan, the executives would be entitled to their
  cash bonuses if they stay with the company through August 29,
  but could receive them earlier if they are fired for reasons
  other than gross and willful misconduct, or if they leave the
  company because their salaries have been sharply cut.
      Spectra-Physics also said it filed suit against Ciba-Geigy
  yesterday in U.S. District Court in Wilmington, Del., charging
  it with making a takeover bid that was false and misleading in
  violation of securities law and with violating the intent of
  July 9, 1985 standstill agreement.
      Spectra-Physics said Ciba-Geigy indicated at the time of
  the standstill agreement that it would not make an unsolicited
  takeover proposal for the company and that the intent of the
  agreement was that Ciba-Geigy would not acquire more than 20
  pct of the company unless there was another takeover threat.
      Ciba-Geigy was 18.8 pct of Spectra-Physics and Reliance
  Group Holdings &lt;REL>, which is controlled by New York investor
  Saul Steinberg, controls 12.8 pct.
      Spectra-Physics said the agreement prevents Ciba-Geigy from
  raising its stake beyond 20 pct through Jan 1, 1992, unless
  another person get more than 10 pct of its voting power.

933,2,"HOLLLINGER &lt;HLG.TO> PAYING 50 MLN DLRS FOR BUY
  Hollinger Inc will pay about 50 mln dlrs
  cash for its previously reported acquisition of privately owned
  Unimedia Inc, chairman Conrad Black told reporters after the
  annual meeting, confirming a published report.
      Commenting on press reports about the 50 mln dlr price tag,
  Black said, ""That would not be wildly inaccurate,"" although he
  declined to disclose the actual cost.
      Montreal-based Unimedia is Quebec's third largest newspaper
  group, with three French language daily newspapers in Quebec
  City, Ottawa and Chicoutimi, Quebec and four printing plants in
  Ontario and Quebec.
      Black added that Hollinger would also continue seeking
  acquisitions of daily newspapers with circulation under 25,000
  readers. He said Hollinger was currently talking to about 10
  such newspapers in the U.S. where the company currently owns 23
  dailies.
      ""There is really no end to the ones that are available,"" he
  told reporters, although he added that most remaining
  acquisition opportunities are in the U.S.
      He said that Hollinger's 58 pct-owned Daily Telegraph PLC,
  of London, should become profitable in this year's fourth
  quarter.
     
      For full-year 1987, the Daily Telegraph could break even or
  better, said Black, citing major reductions in labor costs and
  improved technology at the Telegraph, Britain's largest
  circulation quality daily. The Telegraph lost 13.2 mln Canadian
  dlrs last year.
      Daily Telegraph chief executive Andrew Knight told
  reporters after the meeting that the Telegraph's daily
  circulation had risen by 25,000 since September to about
  1,150,000 on weekdays, despite added competition from the new
  Independent daily newspaper.
     
      Knight said The Independent was not affecting the
  Telegraph's growth, but was making inroads into the circulation
  of other London quality dailies such as The Times and The
  Guardian.
      Hollinger chairman Black predicted Hollinger would post
  1987 net income of about 55 mln dlrs, or one dlr a share,
  including extraordinary gains from previous sales of
  discontinued operations. Hollinger lost 87 mln dlrs or 6.54
  dlrs a share last year on fewer average shares and after an
  extraordinary loss of 52 mln dlrs.
     
      Black told shareholders that first quarter operating
  earnings on continuing operations amounted to 499,000 dlrs
  against a year-ago loss of 165,000 dlrs.
      Revenues on continuing operations rose to 102.1 mln dlrs
  from 1.5 mln dlrs last year, which did not include Daily
  Telegraph revenues, he added. Consolidated first quarter
  figures were not disclosed.
      He said the Daily Telegraph's first quarter operating loss
  was sharply reduced from last year.

943,2,"PHELPS DODGE &lt;PD> SETS SIGHTS ON ACQUISITION
  Phelps Dodge Corp chairman G. Robert
  Durham said the company is prepared to make another large
  non-copper acquisition and that a deal could be struck in the
  near future.
      In an interview with Reuters, Durham said the company was
  examining potential candidates but not yet talking with any.
      He declined to name the companies but said a deal could
  occur as soon as the second half of 1987.
     
      Phelps Dodge, which ranks as the largest copper producer in
  the U.S., last year paid 240 mln dlrs for Columbian Chemicals
  Co, a maker of carbon black which is used in rubber and tires
  among other products.
      The purchase was part of a strategic plan to diversify and
  eventually match earnings from non-copper operations and copper
  operations.
      Phelps Dodge could spend between 250 mln and 500 mln dlrs
  to buy another non-copper company, Durham said, citing about
  100 mln dlrs of cash and 580 mln dlrs of untapped bank credit.
     
      Any acquisition candidate would have to have a different
  economic cycle than copper, substantial earnings and good
  management, he said. Phelps Dodge would only want a friendly
  deal, he added.
      ""We're not talking high-tech, or financial services or
  about a perfume company,"" he said. ""We want a good basic
  industrial company that will fit into our management
  structure,"" Durham said.
     
      During the interview, Durham and other executives also said
  continued strong demand and tight copper supply should lead to
  higher prices for the metal.
      ""In my view, it's not a matter of if but when the price
  (for copper) will improve because there aren't that many new
  projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,
  will continue to grow modestly,"" said executive vice president
  Douglas Yearley. Phelps Dodge continues to lower its cost of
  producing copper, the executives said. Costs should be below 50
  cents a pound, after depreciation but before interest and
  corporate expense, by 1989 or 1990.
      Production costs are about 56 to 57 cents a pound now
  compared to one dlr a pound in 1981, some Wall St analysts
  said.
      Durham said copper supplies are lower than they have been
  for almost 20 years and demand continued to be strong.
      He declined to project results for the second quarter or
  year. But he said the quarter was going well and the rise in
  copper prices in the last month will help results.
      Durham said last month that the second quarter should match
  the first quarter when earnings rose about 11 pct to 16.8 mln
  dlrs or 49 cts a share.
      First quarter sales rose 61.5 pct to 372.9 mln dlrs,
  reflecting the acquisition of Columbian Chemicals and increased
  copper shipments from the Chino copper mine in New Mexico, also
  acquired last year.
      Analysts are projecting 1987 earnings of 2.20 dlrs to 2.75
  dlrs a share, up sharply from 1.79 dlrs in 1986.

  Canada just like the foreign investment that made possible

      The Amoco buyout of debt-burdened Dome has angered Canadian

      Stacy described Amoco Canada's previously reported share
  offer proposal as a chance to increase Canadian ownership of
  the country's oil and gas industry, now at about 50 pct.
      He reiterated that Amoco planned virtually no layoffs of
  Dome employees. He also reaffirmed that Amoco would reinvest in

      Prebble said in a statement the government would appoint an
  adviser to help it decide how the shares should be sold, the
  timing of any sales and the price.
      ""Clearly there will be a need to gauge the effect of other
  proposed share issues so as to enter the market at the best
  opportunity,"" Prebble said.
      ""We are in no particular rush to sell our shares in Air New
  Zealand,"" he said.
      ""Our aim is to maximise the benefit to the taxpayer. If that
  means waiting for a while, then so be it,"" Prebble said.
      He said Air New Zealand expects to release its results soon
  for the year to March 31 1987. He said he was confident it
  would post an excellent profit.
      Prebble said Air New Zealand was successful but its ability
  to prosper in future was hampered by its
  wholly-government-owned status.
      Prebble said access to new sources of capital would
  increase its ability to expand and develop.
      This sale announcement follows the public float in March of
  around 13 pct of the &lt;Bank of New Zealand Ltd>.
      The government has said it will also float part of the
  capital of other state-owned operations, including &lt;DFC New
  Zealand Ltd>, formerly Development Finance Corp of New Zealand
  Ltd, and Petroleum Corp of New Zealand Ltd.

961,2,"FRENCH STATE SELL-OFFS RAISE 52 BILLION FRANCS
  The French government's privatisation
  program, which began late last year, has earned the French
  State about 52 billion francs to date, the Finance Ministry
  said.
      Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the
  revenues raised from the privatisation program would be used in
  priority to pay off public debt, which stood at 398.2 billion
  at the end of 1986.
      The Ministry said in a communique that the returns included
  banking group Societe Generale &lt;SGEN.PA>, which began its
  two-week public flotation last Monday.
      The government has carried out eight flotations, as well as
  the private sale of telephone group &lt;Cie Generale de
  Constructions Telephoniques> (CGCT) since its denationalisation
  scheme began last December with the sell-off of glass makers
  Saint-Gobain &lt;SGEP.PA>, it added.
      The government has pledged to privatise 66 state-owned
  industrial, banking and insurance companies by 1991.
      Other companies to be sold to the private sector in the
  near future are television network TF-1 later this month and
  banking group Cie Financiere de Suez &lt;FSPP.PA> in the autumn.
      The ministry said TF-1's forthcoming sell-off meant that a
  third of the government's programme would have been completed
  in less than nine months.
      Balladur on Sunday rejected press and opposition charges
  that the share prices for privatised companies had been pitched
  too low.
      He said that the average premium of shares trading on the
  Bourse was between 15 and 30 pct over their offer price. This
  compared with premiums of between 60 and 80 pct on similar
  share flotations in Britain.

      ""Stability in oil prices should lead to renewed investment""

      DBS, which Paues said began operations today, brings
  together Sandvik's wholly-owned U.S. Subsidiary Strata Bit Corp
  of Houston and Diamant Boart's petroleum activities in Europe,
  North America, the Middle and Far East and Africa.
      Paues said the merger was a direct result of the sharp fall
  in oil prices 18 months ago which led oil firms to cut back
  exploration activities. Officials said the complementary
  character of the two firms' operations was a further reason.

992,2,"ARCO &lt;ARC> SPIN-OFF SEEN AT 500 MLN DLRS
  Atlantic Richfield Co, considering a
  spin-off of a 20 pct interest in its chemical operations, could
  gain about 500 mln dlrs from the deal, industry analysts
  estimated.
      Yesterday ARCO's stock jumped as much as five points on
  rumors it was spinning off the chemical operations. Based on
  about 183 mln outstanding shares, the market in its frenzy was
  valuing the spin-off at about 900 mln dlrs, analysts said.
      Atlantic Richfield, aware of the rumors, issued a statement
  around mid-day that it was considering a sale of only 20 pct of
  the unit, leading investors to take profits.
      After the announcement, the company's stock retreated,
  closing at 93-7/8, up 1-3/8. Today it was off 1/4.
      ""It was a smaller deal than expected and somewhat
  disappointing,"" said analyst George Baker at Smith Barney. He
  said rumors of the spin-off had been around ""for a couple of
  days.""
      Baker said the unit was very profitable but it wasn't
  getting the type of exposure Atlantic Richfield sought, and its
  value was not reflected in the company's stock price.
      Industry analyst Richard Pzena of Sanford C. Bernstein said
  the unit had operating earnings of 132 mln dlrs last year and
  he expected it to earn about 175 mln dlrs this year.
      Based on a multiple of 17 times earnings--which Pzena says
  chemical companies now sell for--the entire unit is worth about
  three billion dlrs, putting the 20 pct interest at around 500
  to 600 mln dlrs.
      Pzena said he thought the company was selling the stake
  because chemical margins had peaked, and he speculated the
  company would use the proceeds to pay down debt.
      But he added the possibility remained the deal would fall

"
1027,2,"GILLETTE &lt;GS> SEEN OBJECT OF GLOBAL BIDDING WAR
  Ronald Perelman, head of Revlon Group
  Inc &lt;REV>, may be trying to ignite a bidding war for Gillette
  Co that could draw some big international players and in the
  process make a lot of money for himself, Wall Street analysts
  said.
      Several hours before a regularly scheduled board of
  directors meeting, Gillette disclosed that Perelman requested
  consent of its board for an offer of at least 40.50 dlrs per
  share. Perelman needed the consent because he agreed in
  November not to buy stock for 10 years without permission.
      ""I think Ronald Perelman is less interested in Gillette and
  more interested in putting Gillette into play because he stands
  to make a ton of money,"" said Andrew Shore, analyst at Shearson
  Lehman Brothers Inc. ""In play"" is a term used on Wall Street to
  describe what happens when a company becomes an unwiling
  takeover target.
      Shore noted that according to the 1986 agreement Revlon
  gets paid if there is any acquisition of Gillette through
  November of this year at a price higher than 29.75 dlrs per
  share. Gillette rose three to 40 today, following a gain of
  three yesterday.
      The agreement would be calculated on the basis of
  Perelman's previous holding of 18.4 mln shares, adjusted for a
  split. For example, a deal between Gillette and some other
  company at 44 dlrs per share would make Revlon richer by 262
  mln dlrs under the formula. Neither Perelman nor his spokesmen
  returned telephone calls seeking comment.
      ""Revlon stands to make a substantial amount of money if
  someone else takes over Gillette,"" said Analyst Deepak Raj of
  Merrill Lynch and Co. ""I'm not saying that is going to happen
  but Gillette is an undervalued stock with a breakup value of 45
  dlrs per share.""
      Shore of Shearson Lehman said there are a couple of reasons
  why Perelman may not be really interested in acquiring
  Gillette. He said Perelman, in the process of taking Revlon
  private after acquiring control of the cosmetics company two
  years ago, probably wants to concentrate on improving Revlon's
  operations. ""He's trying to overhaul and improve the image of
  the dearptment store business."" Another reason is that Revlon
  has recently made two other acquisitions.
      Under those circumstances, Shore would not be surprised if
  some company such as Unilever plc &lt;UN.AS> or Procter and Gamble
  Co &lt;PG> decided to take a look at Gillette.
      Shore mentioned half a dozen other potential buyers for
  Gillette including Sir James Goldsmith, Hanson Trust plc &lt;HAN>,
  RJR Nabisco Inc &lt;RJR>, American Brands Inc &lt;AMB> and Ralston
  Purina Co &lt;RAL>.
      ""Perelman is trying to put the company in play,"" said a
  Wall Street arbitrageur. ""He gets to share in the upside if the
  company is sold."" Another arbitrageur said he expects Gillette
  to resist Perelman's overture. ""I can't see the board
  consenting, what has changed between November and now,"" he
  said.
     
      Another arbitrageur said he was not sure what was going on.
  ""Perelman never does anything without a fair amount of
  calculation,"" he said. But he added, ""The Gillette board has to
  be careful. They just can't say no or they'll be sued by
  shareholders."" Gillette's board was still meeting at 1700 EDT,
  three and one-half hours after the scheduled starting time.
      According to a copy of Perelman's letter released by
  Gillette, he would be prepared to sign a defnitive merger
  agreement without any financing condition. He said Citibank
  N.A. is his lead lender and First Boston Inc is his financial
  adviser.

1037,2,"SQUIBB &lt;SQB> SAID NOT INTERESTED IN BUYING CETUS
  Robert Fildes, president and chief
  executive of Cetus Corp &lt;CTUS.O>, told Reuters that Squibb Corp
  is not interested in buying Cetus.
      Earlier the companies said Squibb would buy from Cetus a
  five pct equity postion in Cetus for about 40 mln dlrs.
      ""This is not an attempt by Squibb to become a major
  majority holder in Cetus,"" Fildes told Reuters in an interview.
  ""Squibb has not approached us with any indication that they
  want to acquire us and we wouldn't be interested in that kind
  of arrangement,"" said Fildes.
      Squibb could not be reached to comment on the late comments
  by Fildes.
      Squibb is Cetus' first pharmaceutical partner and the only
  one to own an equity position in Cetus. Eastman Kodak Co &lt;EK>
  and W.R. Grace &lt;WR> both have joint ventures with Cetus, but
  neither owns an equity position in the company, said Fildes.
      Cetus has a venture with Kodak to develp diagnostic
  products and with Grace to develop agricultural products.
      Earlier, Squibb and Cetus announced in a joint statement 
  an agreement in principle to form a joint venture to develop
  new biotechnology products in several fields.
     
      As part of the deal Squibb will license several of Cetus'
  anticancer agents, including interleukin-2, in development.
  Squibb will sell the drugs only in Japan and other markets but
  not in North American and Western Europe.
      ""We wouldn't have done this deal had it not been understood
  that Cetus wants to build its own fully integrated business in
  North America and Europe,"" said Fildes.
      He said Squibb was the good partner because Squibb has a
  major joint venture in Japan and has sales capabilities of its
  own in that market.
     
      Fildes said Cetus has shunned licensing arrangements with
  pharmaceutical companies because it wanted to build its own
  business. Many large corporations have invested in small
  biotech firms.
      But Squibb's investment in Cetus is the first it has made
  in biotechnology. Fildes said that was attractive to Cetus
  because it wanted a partner that didn't have a relationship
  with a large number of other biotechnology companies.""
     
      Fildes said his strategy was to have partners in non drug
  areas like diagnostics and agriculture, but to ""keep the
  biggest developments in anticancer drugs to ourselves.""
      Fildes said the partnership with Squibb would be used to
  broaden the company's reach in such big money making areas
  as the cardiovascular, anti-infective and the anti-inflammatory
  markets.
      Squibb is also investming 75 mln dlrs in Cetus' research
  over the next five years.
     
      ""Squibb is putting up over 75 mln dlrs in research and
  development to make it happen, while the equity position part
  of the package is simply to demonstrate the seriousness of this
  partnership,"" said Fildes.

      Sainsbury bought about 21 pct of the stock in 1983. It said
  its U.S. Subsidiary, Chene Investments Inc, bought 2.55 mln
  common shares from the controlling Davis family yesterday at 30

      A tender offer for the outstanding shares will be launched,

      The Shaw's Board and the Davis family has agreed to accept

  pct.
      The company had allotted 20.18 mln new ordinary shares to
  &lt;Warburg Securities Ltd> which it said would be sufficient to
  finance about 188 mln dlrs of the maximum 261 mln dlrs payable.
      Shaw's operates a chain of 49 supermarkets in

  sales of 1.1 billiob dlrs and pretax profit of 31.1 mln. At the

  Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Inc officials

      Officials of First Boston Inc, Harcourt's financial
  adviser, declined comment.
      A Wall Street arbitrageur, who owns Harcourt shares, said
  the rumors did not make much sense because Harcourt has
  announced a recapitalization plan to ward off a takeover
  attempt by British publisher Robert Maxwell.""It's completely
  inconsistent with the recapitalization, the only way is if they
  drop the recapitalization,"" he said.
      Calls to Harcourt seeking comment were not returned.
      Harcourt's recapitalization will come under scrutiny of a
  U.S. Court in Orlando, Fla. Monday. The company has sought a
  declaratory judgment on convertibility of debentures due 2011
  in light of the recapitalization.
      Harcourt said in a statement this week that Salomon
  Brothers Inc &lt;SB> and Mutual Shares Corp have intervened in the
  case, claiming ownership of more than 30 mln dlrs face amount
  of the debenture. In addition, British Printing and
  Communications Corp, headed by Maxwell, owns 9.5 mln dlrs face
  amount, Harcourt said.
      Salomon said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange
  Commission today that it has 21,978 of the debentures. If the
  court decides they should be converted at par value of one dlr,
  they could be converted into 22.0 mln shares.
      Harcourt is asking the court to rule the company is not
  required to issue common to debenture holders who did not
  convert prior to June eight.
      An increase in Reed shares in London today was attributed
  by brokers to rumors of Harcourt's interest and also to rumors
  that Maxwell might be a buyer. But an adviser to Maxwell in New

  One of several investor groups
  formerly associated with London investor Christopher Moran in
  his unsuccessful bid to take over Zondervan Corp last year,
  said it cut its stake in the company to less than five pct.
      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  the group, led by investors Lawrence Altschul and James
  Apostolakis, said it cut its Zondervan stake to 157,500 shares,
  or 3.8 pct of the total, from 246,500 shares, or 5.9 pct.
      The group, which earlier this month said in an SEC filing
  it wanted join with other groups to maximize share values, said
  it sold 89,000 shares between June 9 and 15 for 1.5 mln dlrs.
      The group had joined with the Moran group, which last year
  assembled a combined 44 pct stake in Zondervan during its
  unsuccessful takeover try.
      Last month, the Moran group broke up and splintered into
  various factions. Moran himself withdrew from the takeover
  effort and last reported his personal stake at 4.8 pct.
      A group led by Miwok Capital Corp, a California broker with
  a 10.6 pct stake, and another one led by Minneapolis
  stockbroker Jeffrey Wendel with 2.6 pct, have both made recent
  SEC filings saying they are seeking agreements with other
  parties who may want to seek control of the company.
  

"
1121,2,"NEW LEADER COMING TO U.S. SEC IN CHALLENGING ERA
  President Reagan's nominee as top
  policeman for the nation's securities markets will inherit an
  agency challenged by an insider trading scandal, wild stock
  price gyrations and a host of uncertainties stemming from the
  globalization of financial markets.
      David Ruder, a 58-year-old Republican law professor at
  Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., was named Thursday
  to be the 23rd chairman of the five-member U.S. Securities and
  Exchange Commission.
      If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, he will succeed
  John Shad, who left the agency earlier this week after a record
  six years as chairman to become ambassador to the Netherlands.
      The SEC has been in the limelight for the past year as its
  investigators have probed into the most colossal insider
  trading scandal ever uncovered on Wall Street.
      The investigation, which is still active, mushroomed in
  recent months as a growing number of well known traders and
  prominent investment banking firms have been charged with
  wrongdoing.
      The pace of the probe picked up markedly in November after
  Ivan Boesky, one of Wall Street's most successful stock
  speculators, agreed to cooperate with government investigators
  and to pay a record 100 mln dlrs in penalties and illegal
  profits after being charged with insider trading.
      But the agency is also wrestling with a vexing new
  phenomenon of huge and rapid swings in stock prices, spurred by
  computer-driven trading strategies that span markets in 
  securities, options and futures. The price gyrations have
  combined with rising trading volumes to bring unprecedented
  volatility to some U.S. securities markets.
      At the same time, the SEC is being pressed by some
  lawmakers to put a stop to abusive tactics in corporate
  takeover contests as an unrelenting wave of such takeovers
  steadily reshapes the U.S. corporate landscape.
      And the agency is being pushed by U.S. and foreign
  exchanges intent on expansion to lay the regulatory groundwork
  for an international securities marketplace in which trading
  occurs across borders throughout the world, around the clock.
      Such worldwide trading networks offer vast new investment
  opportunities but could strain the SEC's ability to enforce
  U.S. securities laws and guard investors from fraud.
      Under the leadership of Shad, the SEC eased financial
  disclosure requirements for publicly traded companies,
  eliminated many minor investor protection rules, attempted to
  spur competition among exchanges and streamlined the agency's
  review of hostile corporate takeovers.
      Shad, who had been vice chairman of the E. F. Hutton
  investment banking firm, brought a Wall Street perspective to
  the agency upon being named chairman in 1981.
      In line with the views of other top administration
  officials, he favored marketplace determination of takeover
  battles over new federal regulations.
      The SEC under Shad also stressed prosecution of insider
  trading violations over the corporate wrongdoing cases that
  topped the agency's enforcement agenda during the
  administration of President Jimmy Carter, a Democrat.
      Securities lawyers and industry officials acquainted with
  Ruder say the new chairman-designate is unlikely to
  significantly alter the commission's current priorities.
      The SEC currently has about 2,000 employees, most of them
  lawyers, and an annual budget of about 115 mln dlrs though that
  figure likely will be significantly higher next year as the
  agency moves to beef up its enforcement staff.
      The agency is one of the few in the government that
  actually has taken in more money than it has spent in the past
  few years because of fees it charges public companies,
  investment banks and other securities firms it regulates.
      The SEC is structured as an independent regulatory agency,
  meaning that its five commissioners are appointed by the
  president to fixed five-year terms and protected from firing
  for policy differences alone.
      By law, no more than three commissioners may be of the same
  political party, and the agency prepares its own budget request
  each year instead of leaving this to the White House.
      Established by Congress in 1934, the SEC traces its origins
  to the great stock market crash of 1929, which was attributed
  in large part to widespread trading on credit and attempted
  market manipulations by large investment firms.
      The agency requires public companies and investment
  vehicles such as mutual funds to issue periodic reports on
  their financial condition and to disclose changes in their
  condition any time they issue new securities.
      It requires brokers, dealers and investment banks to
  register with it and comply with investor protection rules, and
  it polices exchanges and regulates trading practices.
      Its first chairman was Joseph Kennedy, an industrial
  magnate who was also the father of John Kennedy, later to
  become the nation's 35th president.
      Other former chairmen include William Douglas, who served
  from 1937 until his appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court in
  1939, and William Casey, who served during President Nixon's
  first term and was Reagan's director of the Central
  Intelligence Agency until his death earlier this year.

  National Computer Systems Inc &lt;NLCS.O>.
      DataCard declared a dividend distribution of one preferred

  other potential suitors from preventing DataCard from
  evaluating all alternatives to maximize shareholder value,
  DataCard said.
     
      National Computer told Reuters June 22 it could make a bid
  for DataCard. On June 25 DataCard filed suit in Hennepin County
  District Court in Minnesota to block the sale of the 38 pct
  stake of its stock to National Computer.
      In announcing the rights plan, DataCard said it ""is not
  designed to deter takeovers that would be consistent with the
  objective of maximizing stockholders value to all of DataCard's
  stockholders.""
      The rights will not become exercisable until 10 days after
  an announcement that a person or group has acquired beneficial
  ownership of 44 pct or more of DataCard's common stock.
     
      Once exercisable, each right would entitle a holder to buy
  1/500th of a share of DataCard Series A junior participation
  preferred Stock for 35 dlrs. Holders other than an acquirer
  would be entitled to purchase, for six-months after the right
  becomes exercisable, a number of shares of the new preferred

  Enetertainment Marketing Inc and its

  shareholders from the company and said they may pursue a merger
  of the Edison, N.J. electronics retailer.
      In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
  Zinn said the demand for the shareholder list was made on June
  26 because he may desire to communicate with other Crazy Eddie
  shareholders ""regarding the affairs"" of the company.
      Zinn and his firm, which disclosed they hold a 5.1 pct
  stake in Crazy Eddie common stock, said they may acquire more
  shares through a negotiated merger or tender offer.
      Entertainment Marketing was informed on June 25 by Shearson
  Lehman Brothers Inc., acting on behalf of Crazy Eddie, that it
  would be provided with ""certain information"" about Crazy Eddie,
  it told the SEC.
      Entertainment Marketing, a Houston-based firm involved in
  electronics wholesaling and televised home shopping sales,
  proposed an eight dlr a share merger acquisition of Crazy Eddie
  on May 29, and modified the proposal on June 9 to include the
  possible participation of Crazy Eddie management.
      Entertainment Marketing told the SEC it expects to meet
  with Crazy Eddie representatives in the near future.
      Entertainment Marketing also disclosed that it retained
  Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc as its financial advisor and
  investment banker.
      In light of a June 17 announcement from Crazy Eddie that
  Chemical Bank would no longer fund a 52 mln dlr credit facility
  with the company, plus further declines in the price of its
  stock, Entertainment Marketing and Zinn said they are
  ""continuing to evaluate their alternatives with respect to
  their investment"" in Crazy Eddie stock.
      Depending on its evaluation of the company, including
  actions by Crazy Eddie's board and any possible third party
  bids for the company, Entertainment Marketing and its president
  said they may hold their present stake in the company, sell
  some of their shares, or purchase more shares on the open
  market, through private purchases or in connection with a

      According to the SEC filing, Entertainment Marketing and
  Zinn bought their current holdings of 1,560,000 Crazy Eddie

1197,2,"SEC SAYS CAMPEAU UNIT VIOLATED DISCLOSURE RULES
  The Securities and Exchange
  Commission charged Allied Stores Corp with failing to promptly
  disclose key steps it was taking last September to thwart a
  takeover attempt by Campeau Corp.
      In an administrative complaint, the SEC said Allied and its
  legal adviser failed to promptly inform shareholders and the
  agency that it had begun talks with Youngstown, Ohio, shopping
  center developer Edward DeBartolo in response to Campeau's
  takeover offer.
      Campeau acquired Allied for an estimated 4.2 billion dlrs
  on Jan 1, following a battle with DeBartolo.
      On Sept 25, a day after Allied disclosed that its board had
  urged rejection of Campeau's Sept 12 tender offer for 58 dlrs a
  share, Allied began negotiating the sale of six shopping
  centers to DeBartolo, the SEC said.
      Allied legal advisor and director George Kern, who heads
  the merger and acquisitions group at the New York law firm of
  Sullivan and Cromwell, decided against amending Allied's SEC
  filing to disclose the talks even though they had resulted in
  sales price of 405 mln dlrs for the shopping centers, it said.
      Securities law requires takeover target companies to
  promptly disclose such things as the sale of major assets.
      The day after Campeau increased its tender offer to 80 pct
  of Allied's stock from 55 pct and raised its bid to 66 dlrs a
  share from 58 dlrs on Sept 29, Allied and a partnership headed
  by DeBartolo began negotiating a takeover deal aimed at
  thwarting Campeau, the SEC said.
      Kern again decided against disclosing the talks in an
  amended SEC filing, the agency charged.
      Allied's first disclosure of the DeBartolo takeover was
  made on Oct 8, even though its board approved the merger on Oct
  3 and the merger agreement was executed on Oct 7, the complaint
  said.
      DeBartolo and Campeau later engaged in a bitter battle for
  control of Allied, with Campeau winning out later in October
  when it bought a block of 25.8 mln shares of Allied stock, or
  48 pct of the total, in a controversial move made only minutes
  after it dropped its hostile tender offer.
      The acquisition of the additional 48 pct, which a federal
  judge allowed to be completed, gave Campeau a majority stake in
  Allied. Campeau bought the rest at 69 dlrs a share.
      The SEC said it had planned to file a court brief joining
  with Allied in charging that Campeau had engaged in an illegal
  tender offer.
      But the SEC brief was never filed since the case was
  dropped following an agreement between Campeau and DeBartolo.
      In the administrative proceeding against Allied and Kern,
  the SEC is asking for an administrative order that they comply
  with reporting provisions of securities laws in the future.
      Although Allied is no longer publicly traded since it
  became a subsidiary of Campeau, it still files annual and
  quarterly reports to the SEC because it has outstanding debt.

"
1218,2,"SAN FRANCISCO, NOT REGION, HURT BY RESTRUCTURING
  Corporate mergers and acquisitions
  in and around San Francisco over the past seven years have had
  only a modest effect on the metropolitan area's economy, a
  leading business-backed organization said.
      The Bay Area Council, a group of more than 300 business
  firms, said that a study of corporate restructuring in a
  nine-county area found that San Francisco itself had suffered
  some ill effects from corporate shake-ups but that surrounding
  communities had not.
      Seventeen of the 32 Fortune 500 companies in the area left
  due to corporate restructuring between 1979 and 1986, but
  another 21 firms were added to the list.
      Ten of the departing companies were based in San Francisco.
  During the period, only six located in the city achieved
  Fortune 500 status.
      Ted Hall, a council director and local managing director of
  McKinsey and Co. which conducted the survey, said the study
  grew out of concern that mergers and acquisitions had seriously
  hurt the economic climate of northern California.
      However, Hall said that only about 36,000 jobs had been
  lost in the region, while more than 600,000 new jobs were
  created during the period.
      At the same time, he said, the region experienced a greater
  rise in per capita income and lower unemployment than the rest
  of the United States and California.
      Council President George Keller, who also is chairman and
  chief executive officer of Chevron Corp., told a news
  conference that the region had difficulties in persuading
  companies to locate there because of a fragmented local
  political system.
      But he said that because of the amenities of living in San
  Francisco, he was the envy of many chief executives in other
  metropolitan area.
      ""It's a great place to run a business,"" he added, ""but it's
  a hell of a place to do business with government.""
      The study concluded that Chevron, which mergered with Gulf
  Oil in 1984, would benefit in the long run from the
  restructuring activity.
      Among the corporate headquarters lost during the period
  were Crown Zellerbach, Memorex, Southern Pacific, Castle &amp;
  Cooke and Rolm.
      Companies that grew enough during the period to make the
  Fortune 500 list included Apple Computer, Pacific Telesis,
  McKesson, Tandem Computer, U.S. Leasing and Amfac.
      The study by the management consulting firm said that,
  partly due to corporate restructuring, the rate of job growth
  in San Francisco has slowed since 1980.
      In addition, it said that the loss of corporate leadership
  had adversely affected some of the Bay Area's civic and
  charitable activities.

  GENCORP INC SAYS TO SELL GENERAL TIRE TO CONTINENTAL
  GUMMI FOR 650 MLN DLRS
  

"
1247,2,"GENCORP &lt;GY> TO SELL GENERAL TIRE
  Gencorp Inc and Continental AG of
  Hanover, West Germany, jointy announced they signed an
  agreement for Continental to buy Gencorp's General Tire Inc
  subsidiary for 650 mln dlrs in cash.
      Under the agreement the companies said Continental will
  acquire General Tire, including its related domestic and
  foreign operations, and Gencorp will retain liability for the
  medical benefits of retired General Tire employees who retired
  on or before November 30, 1984.
      The sale is expected to be completed on or before November
  one and is subject to meeting certain conditions.
      Continental is Europe's second largest tire producer. Last
  year, the company had sales of 2.6 billion dlrs, with 1.9
  billion dlrs generated by its tire operations.
      Last year, General Tire had operating profits of 79 mln
  dlrs on sales of 1.1 billion dlrs, and Gencorp had operating
  profits of 130 mln dlrs on sales of 3.1 billion dlrs.
      GenCorp spokesman Rip Tilden said the company will retain
  about 100 mln dlrs in liability for its former General Tire
  employees under the agreement.
      Tilden said Gencorp will use the proceeds from the sale to
  reduce its 1.5 billion dlr debt.
      In April, GenCorp sucessfully thwarted a takeover by a
  partnership formed by AFG Industries Inc &lt;AFG> and Wagner and
  Brown with a restructuring program that included the purchase
  of up to 54 pct, or 12.5 mln shares, of its common at 130 dlrs
  a share for a total of 1.6 billion dlrs
      As part of the restructuring, GenCorp also said it planned
  to sell its tire business, the bottling operations of its RKO
  General Inc subsidiary, and RKO's remaining broadcast
  properties to focus on the company's aerospace and automotive
  components businesses.
     
      Tilden said Gencorp expects to realize about 850 mln dlrs
  in after tax proceeds by the end of 1987 as a result of sale of
  several pieces of the nonbroadcast assets of the company,
  including general tire.
      ""The price paid for General tire would not cause us to
  reevaluate that estimate,"" said Tilden.
      General Tire employs 10,000 people worldwide and has four
  tire manufacturing plants in the U.S. and one in Canada.
      In a statemnet, A. William Reynolds, GenCorp chairman said
  the sale of General Tire ""represents a critical accomplishment
  in our plan to restructure GenCorp.""
     
      Reynolds also said GenCorp's previously announced sale of
  its other businesses are ""proceeding satisfactorily.""
      Among the pieces of Gencorp's empire that remain to be sold
  are its RKO bottling operations. GenCorp agreed to sell RKO's
  KHJ-TV station to Walt Disney Co &lt;DIS> for
  217 mln dlrs. That deal awaits approval by the Federal
  Communications Commission. GenCorp also received 257 dlrs after
  tax from the sale of RKO's WOR-TV.

      At the request of the board, Rorer has agreed to extend

      After Rorer announced its second bid for the company last

      But, the analysts added, that Robins desire to emerge
  independent from two years of bankruptcy proceedings may be
  thwarted by some Robins' shareholders who perceive a merger as
  a more expedient way of dealing with the company's Dalkon
  Shield related liabilities.
      After a failed first attempt earlier this year, Rorer's
  latest merger plan calls for a share swap worth about 720 mln
  dlrs.
      Rorer would also set up two trusts to cover the estimated

1253,2,"CITICORP &lt;CCI> SAVINGS EXTENDS CALIFORNIA REACH
  Citicorp has extended its reach
  into the California market with Citicorp Savings' acquisition
  of 50 of Sears Roebuck's &lt;S> Sears Savings Bank branches,
  bringing its presences to 143 branches in 101 communities,
  CitiCorp Savings said.
      Thrift industry analysts said the move, approved by the
  Federal Reserve board today, is a plus for Citicorp and shows
  its serious intent to penetrate the California market.
      The acquisition mostly extends Citicorp's reach into
  Southern California, where 34 of the 50 branches are located.
  Citicorp Savings was predominantly in Northern California.
      ""This marks our first major expansion in California,
  particularly in the south,"" said Citicorp Savings President
  Edward Valencia, in a statement.
      Thrift industry sources said they do not see a major
  near-term impact on the Southern California thrift market, but
  do expect Citicorp to be a more aggressive competitor than
  Sears was in that market.
      ""We do believe they will be a better competitor than
  Sears,"" said James Stutz, Executive Vice President of Home
  Federal Savings and Loan Association &lt;HFD>, based in San Diego.
      Banking industry sources said the move is viewed as
  groundwork, to establish Citicorp throughout the California
  market, well before the 1991 law change that will allow it to
  operate as a bank in the state. They said Citicorp is likely to
  convert the branches to banks at that time.
      In the near-term, however, analysts said with seven billion
  dlrs in assets, Citicorp Savings is still not a major force in
  the thrift market, against such large California thrifts as
  Home Federal, Great Western Financial Corp &lt;GWF>, H F Ahmanson
  and Co &lt;AHM>, Golden West  Financial &lt;GWD> and Great American

1261,2,"JUSTICE OPPOSES QUICK GREYHOUND-TRAILWAYS MERGER
  The Justice Department said it asked
  the government to proceed cautiously on a plan allowing the
  nation's two largest intercity bus companies to merge their
  operations, a move one of the firms said may derail the deal.
      Justice's opposition to quick federal approval of a bid by
  Greyhound Lines Inc to take immediate control Trailways Corp
  prompted Greyhound to threaten -- in a brief filed with the
  Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) -- to drop the merger
  plan.
      Greyhound officials told Reuters late today the company
  hoped for ICC action on the merger by tomorrow.
      ""Greyhound Lines will go forward with the transaction only
  if it is permitted to assume immediate, unconditional control
  of Trailways' operations and to integrate them with its
  operations,"" Greyhound said in a filing with the ICC, the
  federal regulatory agency which has the final say over mergers
  of interstate bus companies.
      But Justice had said in an earlier filing with the ICC that
  it wanted the agency to move slowly on the plan and to turn
  down Greyhound's request to begin operating Trailways
  immediately.
      ""The department has just begun to receive relevant
  information on Trailways' financial condition and is in the
  process of assessing the correctness of the company's
  allegations,"" acting Assistant Attorney General Charles Rule
  said in comments submitted to the ICC.
      Greyhound announced June 19 that it wanted the ICC to let
  it begin operating Trailways immediately while continuing to
  evaluate the merger for possible antitrust problems.
      Greyhound said it would pay 80 mln dlrs for many of
  Trailways' terminals, buses and garages.
      The two companies said in papers filed with the ICC that
  Trailways ""could collapse in a matter of days.""
      They said Trailways owed suppliers more than six mln dlrs,
  with another six mln dlrs due June 30.
      The suppliers, they said, could force Trailways into
  bankruptcy ""at any time.""
      Trailways also owes a consortium of banks 76 mln dlrs, and
  the consortium has threatened to call the loan if Trailways
  fails to pay the interest due June 30, they said.

      Crazy Eddie said the new amendments limit future amendments
  to the plan, modify the definition of ""continuing directors""
  and permit amendment or termination of the plan with the
  consent of the company's shareholders if there are no
  continuing directors in office or the approval of at least
  three such directors cannot be obtained.

  Minneapolis investor Irwin Jacobs said he

  he could not force Gillette to accept a 47 dlr a share takeover
  bid made by Revlon Group Inc &lt;REV>.
      Revlon's bid expired last week after being repeatedly
  rejected by Gillette. Jacobs had earlier considered waging a
  proxy fight over Gillette.
      Jacobs told Reuters he sold the Gillette stake, which he
  called ""substantial"" but under five pct, a few weeks ago over a
  period of several days. He said he sold the stock at a profit,
  but did not disclose the selling price.
      Gillette's stock was at 24-1/8, up 1/8, in morning trade,
  off the high of 45-7/8 reached after Revlon announced its bid.
      Jacobs said he sold his Gillette stake based on an
  ""investment decision. I surely did not see this happening,"" he
  said of Monday's stock market free-fall.
      A Gillette spokesman said the mpany had no comment.
      Jacobs said he and fellow investor Carl Pohlad continue to
  hold a stake in Allegheny International Inc &lt;AG>. In August
  they disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing
  that they had acquired 854,900 shares, or 7.9 pct, of Allegheny

  Telex Corp said its board adopted a

      However, the company said the plan will not be triggered by
  purchases pursuant to the 65 dlrs a share tender offer
  commenced on October 9 by a unit of TLX Partners, a group
  controlled by New York financier Asher Edelman.
      It said the rights will be distributed on a one for one
  basis to all shareholders as of October 30 and may be redeemed
  before they become exercisable at five cents per right.
      The company said the rights will expire on the later of
  February 17 next year or 60 days from the date they become
  exercisable. It said the plan was intended to protect
  stockholders against any attempt to take unfair advantage of
  the recent decline in stock prices or to use abusive tactics
  such as market accumulations which would interfere with its
  ability to maximize stockholder value.
      The rights become exercisable if any person or group
  acquires 15 pct or more of the company's common stock other
  than through an all cash tender offer for all outstanding
  shares at 65 dlrs per share.
       It said the rights will also not become exercisable if the
  company is acquired by a group under an agreement made with its
  board.
       A spokeswoman told Reuters the company would have an
  official response to Edelman's bid by Friday, Oct 23.

  The Bank of New York Corp &lt;BK> said it
  reaffirmed the terms of its offer for Irving Bank Corp despite
  the drop in the Bank of New York's share price to 30-1/8, a
  Bank of New York spokesman said.
      ""The offer still stands, we have not changed our offer,"" a
  Bank of New York spokesman said.
      Irving would not comment on how the drop in the market
  affects its position on the bid or whether it would buy back
  any of its own shares.
      Earlier this month, Irving rejected the bid as inadequate
  and said it wanted to retain its independence.
      In late September, Bank of New York offered 80 dlrs per
  share in cash for 47.4 pct of Irving. For the remaining 52.6
  pct, it offered an exchange of 1.9 shares of its shares for one
  Irving share.
      At that time, the stock purchase portion was worth close to
  80 dlrs per share, but now that portion is worth 53 dlrs per
  share for a net price of 68 dlrs, one analyst said.
      According to the prospectus offer, shareholders may tender
  for all cash or all shares on a first come, first serve basis.
      Analysts were mixed about how the stock price drop would
  affect the acquisition.
      ""If it gets to the Irving shareholders, they would approve
  it, but Irving hopes the offer won't go to the shareholders,""
  said Mark Alpert, banking analyst with Bear Stearns Cos Inc.
      ""And the market is saying the deal won't go through,""
  Alpert said.
      ""The transaction looks highly unlikely to be completed at
  present. If Irving wouldn't go with the offer at 80 dlrs a
  share, then they won't go at a lower price,"" another analyst
  said.
      The analyst also doubted that Bank of New York could afford
  to retain its original offer.
      However, industry sources were more uncertain about
  prospects for the deal.
      ""With Irving's price so low, Bank of New York's offer will
  look good to Irving shareholders,"" said Michael Flores, a
  consultant at Bank Earnings International, a consulting firm.
      The drop of Irving's share to 44 dlrs per share, which is
  about a 26 dlr drop from the beginning of last week, increases
  the chance that Bank of New York will succeed, Flores said.
      Analysts said that the drop in bank stock prices is likely
  to depress the level of mergers and acquisition in the banking
  industry.
      ""Bank takeovers are less likely because banks can't use
  their own stock to make acquisitions because their share price
  is too depressed,"" Alpert said.
      Since only banks can buy another bank, the only other
  possible acquirors would be a foreign bank, Alpert said.
      ""In the market drop the stock of acquirors got clobbered
  more than the acquirees,"" another analyst said.

  Northeast Savings F.A. said its
  board adopted a shareholder rights plan designed to protect the
  company from coercive takeover tactics and bids not fair to all
  sharholders.
      Under the plan, the board declared a dividend of one share
  purchase right for each of the Northeast common shares held of
  record as of November two, the company said.
      Initially, the rights are not exerciseable, rights
  certificates are not distributed, and the rights automatically
  trade with Northeast's shares, the company said.
      However, 20 days following the acquisition of 20 pct or
  more of Northeast's common shares shares or 20 days following
  the commencement of a tender offer for 30 pct or more of
  Northeast's shares, the rights will become exerciseable and
  separate rights certificates will be distributed, the company
  said.
      The rights will entitle holders of Northeast's common
  shares to purchase additional shares at an exercise price of 60
  dlrs a share, the company said.
      The company said that in the event of certain triggering
  events described in the rights plan, holders of the rights,
  other than an acquiring person, will be entitled to acquire
  Northeast's common shares having a market value of twice the
  then-current exercise price of the rights. Also, in the event
  Northeast enters into certain business combination
  transactions, holders of the rights will be provided a right to
  acquire equity securities of the acquiring entity having a
  market value of twice the then-current exercise price of the
  rights, the company said. Northeast said it will be entitled to
  redeem the rights at one cent per right until the occurence of
  certain events.

  Baring Capital Investors Ltd (BCI), a unit

  has raised 61 mln European Currency Units (ECUs) which will be
  invested in management buy-outs and development capital
  opportunities in the U.K. And continental Europe.
      The funds were raised through BCI's first such fund - the
  Baring Euaring European Capital Trust - from investors in nine
  European countries. It expects to raise another 40 mln ECUs
  soon through a French fund and a fund for U.S. Investors.
      BCI was set up last year by Baring Brothers to advise
  buy-out and development capital investors.
      BCI said the new fund is structured as a Guernsey-based
  unit trust, which will be listed on the Luxembourg Stock
  Exchange. It will be advised by BCI and managed by a company
  owned jointly by Barings and the management of BCI.
      Individual investments are expected to range between one
  and 10 mln ECUs and are likely to be concentrated in the U.K.,
  Germany and France.
      BCI said its aims are to invest in established companies,
  principally family companies with succession-issues and
  corporate spin-offs.

  and the &lt;Oppenheimer-Palmieri Fund, LP.>
      Crazy Eddie said its board is not endorsing, but will
  simply refrain from opposing, the EMI-Palmieri nominees.    
  The board also said it will ask representatives of the
  Committee to Restore Shareholder value to begin acquainting
  themselves with the business and affairs of the company as
  promptly as possible.
     
      To that end, the committee's representatives will be
  invited in advance of the annual meeting to examine the
  company's financial records, to monitor its operations and to
  join company officers in meetings with the company's suppliers,
  bankers and key personnel, Crazy Eddie said.
      The board said that to continue to oppose the EMI-Palmieri
  group would only increase the expenses of the company, create
  further uncertainty among its suppliers, customers and
  employees, and result in deterioration of moral among company
  personnel.
      A further release from the company will follow, it said.

  one-for-one basis for shares in the combined company.
      It said holders of Robert Halmi common will exchange their
  shares on a two-and-one-half-for-one basis for shares in the
  combined company.
      The company said the swap will be tax-free.
      The company also said &lt;Qintex Ltd>, a 35 pct owner of Hal
  Roach common stock, has agreed to use the company as the
  exclusive vehicle for its U.S. media and entertainment
  investments, the company said.
      The company said Qintex's U.S. subsidiary also agreed to
  supply a minimum 70 mln dlrs line of credit to the new company,
  which shall be used, with Qintex approval, for financing new
  HRI products.
      The company said that under the definitive agreement,
  Qintex's U.S. division will have the right to purchase up to 51
  pct of the new company in the open market, in private
  transactions or by tender offer, but will not be purchasing
  warrants to bring its ownership to 51 pct of the new company.
      If Qintex's U.S. subsidiary has not achieved this ownership
  within one year after the completion of the merger, the
  subsidiary will have the right two years thereafter to request
  that HRI commence a rights offering to HRI stockholders, the
  company said.
      Regarding the potential rights offering, Qintex's U.S.
  subsidiary will act as standby purchaser, the company said.
      The transaction is subject to the approval of both
  company's shareholders, the receipt of certain tax approvals,
  and the continued employement of Robert Halmi Sr and Robert
  Halmi Jr, the company said.
      Robert Halmi Sr, who is currently chairman and chief
  executive officer of Robert Halmi Inc, will be chairman of the
  new company and David Evans, current president and chief
  operating officer of Hal Roach, will become chief executive,
  the company said.

  International Multifoods Corp
  said it filed a suit charging Bregman Partners and its
  affiliates unlawfully planned to acquire control of the
  company.
      In a suit filed in U.S. District Court, International
  Multifoods said Bregman Partners and its affiliates, who
  reportedly hold 7.4 pct of the company's shares, tried to
  induce Multifood's management to join them in an effort to take
  the company private and give controlling interest to Bregman
  Partners. Bregman Partners include the interests of the
  Belzberg families of Canada.
      The complaint also discloses that on each occasion,
  Multifoods management rejected the group's overtures.
      Multifoods is asking Bregman's group to divest its shares
  in open market sales in a manner not to further disrupt the
  market place, according to the suit. The suit seeks
  compensatory and punitive damages in an amount to be
  determined.
      In addition, Multifoods is seeking to stop Bregman Partners
  from acquiring any more stock, or voting the shares it
  reportedly owns, the suit said.
      According to Multifoods, the actions proposed by Bregman
  Partners would prevent shareholders from realizing the full
  benefits of the company's restructuring.
      In the past three years, Multifoods has substantially
  altered its domestic business mix by divesting its U.S.
  consumere foods operations and emphasizing growth in selected
  segments of the U.S. foodservice industry.
